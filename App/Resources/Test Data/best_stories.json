This is why I don&#x27;t think voting with online peramters, like down voting, will ever be viable choice; because aside from things like Cybil attacks, the reality is that Social Media has normalized and acutely optimized group think and the tribalism that often follow. For those of that don&#x27;t engage in it its incredibly alarming and disconcerting how many succumb to it&#x27;s practices in real Life.<p>What I will propose as an alternative is something that was first tried with Andreas Antonpolus&#x27; first book &#x27;Mastering Bitcoin&#x27; wherein the chapters are each individually uploaded to Github and follows the same process that OSS does, wherein commits and corrections are submitted to alter the books ultimate maintained version, and never really being fully &#x27;finished&#x27; and can be amended and annotated as needed to suit the updates that follow (eg: Segwit or Lightening Network) or in this case perhaps a replicated experiment that provides a larger sample size. Replication in Academic Papers is nearly non-existant, despite the notion that Peer Reviewed (especially in STEM) was to be a the critical component that made it invaluable.<p>This could also effectively undo the walled-garden-extrotionist model that afflicts Academia&#x27;s Peer Reviewed model and foster more interactive and International work without being present in a University. Samples or specimens may need to be more tightly controlled and transported, but this could effectively be done over night if the Will exists for little to no money in anything other than training.<p>If the International University model is undergoing mass disruption and shifting toward a mainly online learning platform, this too could help mitigate these glaring problems and have a Global Repository for ongoing research.<p>Its almost stupid not to do it at this point given the MANY pitfalls that its current model forces down our throats.",

                "text": "The obvious way to assess if availability is the factor is to look at open access publications. Elsevier (unsurprisingly) say it makes no difference [1] and there are confounding effects which are stronger. For example, papers with code tend to be cited more in ML. And it&#x27;s very difficult to control for article quality, which is a big factor (MDPI&#x27;s quality is extremely hit&#x2F;miss, for example). Open access may improve your paper&#x27;s reach, but will it actually give you more citations? Unclear. I&#x27;m very much in favour of open research though.<p>On the matter of Sci-Hub. I already have access to all the journals I commonly use via my university. Those journals almost certainly track downloads (Elsevier even has a recommender system when you download a paper). All Sci-Hub does is reduce friction for researchers who can&#x27;t be bothered to use their institutional login while off campus. Admittedly that includes a lot of people, but for the people who measurably contribute to citation metrics, does Sci-Hub actually improve availability? I doubt it, at least in universities with budgets for subscriptions. Before Sci-Hub there were always routes to get papers: ask the author or ask a colleague in a neighbouring university if they have access. Or you can ask your library who may be able to get it.<p>My point is that generally it was a bit more work sometimes, but in the grand scheme of publishing a paper, it wasn&#x27;t so bad to network to get access to things.<p>It&#x27;s certainly enabled the general public to access research and no doubt tons of small companies are using it to avoid paying for subscription fees, but those people aren&#x27;t significantly publishing papers in places where we can measure it.<p>All this study shows is that paper downloads <i>from anywhere</i> is a proxy for popularity&#x2F;hype which can be a proxy for citation count. I&#x27;m sure Elsevier or Taylor or Nature could provide a similar correlation between downloads and citations. There is also a bias here - if I&#x27;m looking for papers, I&#x27;m probably going to download the most highly cited stuff first because that&#x27;s a weak signal that it&#x27;s a useful paper.<p>I&#x27;d be more interested to see, as you said, temporal analysis of before&#x2F;after Sci-Hub.<p>Or alternatively geographical studies - does this affect lower income countries more? I imagine that this is a boon to researchers who didn&#x27;t have access because their institution couldn&#x27;t afford it.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elsevier.com&#x2F;connect&#x2F;citation-metrics-and-open-access-what-do-we-know\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elsevier.com&#x2F;connect&#x2F;citation-metrics-and-open-a...</a>",

On your analysis, where Sci-Hub downloads are driven by interest from scientists and that explains the entire more-downloads-means-more-citations effect, that conclusion is 100% correct.",

[1]<p>There are plenty of problems with BDFL-style projects, but I think there are a lot of advantages too.  Redis is unique in my experience in that it works the way you&#x27;d expect - it doesn&#x27;t cause outages, it is fast, and it has a vanishingly small number of gotchas.  The feature set is well curated and for the most part fits together cohesively.<p>The most important thing Antirez did, in my opinion, was to say &quot;No&quot; to things.  No to new features that didn&#x27;t make sense.  No to PRs that didn&#x27;t fit the vision.  Saying no is one of the most important jobs of a project maintainer. It&#x27;s a thankless task that upsets a lot of people.  But it&#x27;s critical for a project to stay successful and achieve the leader&#x27;s vision.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m a pessimist, but I predict after a few years of this new model we&#x27;ll see weird features, more stability issues, and performance regressions as more cooks enter the kitchen.

I have yet to see many real world messaging scenarios where you don&#x27;t end up using both.<p>A &quot;proper&quot; message bus needs to have topics, exchanges and queues - like Rabbit.  50% of that functionality is usually not 50% of the value but 10% or less (especially when you consider all the other things about Redis you need to think about - like how eviction is configured).<p>This is a bit typical of Redis: for any X, you can normally do X in Redis, but is it really a good idea to do X in Redis?  IMO, usually no.",

A single chief architect (or a small number of architects), acting on the user&#x27;s behalf, decides what goes in the system and what stays out. The architect or team of architects should develop an idea of what the system should do and make sure that this vision is understood by the rest of the team. A novel idea by someone may not be included if it does not fit seamlessly with the overall system design. In fact, to ensure a user-friendly system, a system may deliberately provide fewer features than it is capable of. The point being, if a system is too complicated to use, many features will go unused because no one has time to learn them.<p>* (This is quoted from the Wikipedia page as I don&#x27;t have an online copy of MMM to hand).",

Further still, once you&#x27;ve established a racial worldview with a racial hierarchy that puts whites on the bottom, you&#x27;ve established a framework that facilitates white supremacist arguments (both by making it easier to frame whites as victims of racism and by validating racial worldviews in general--a worldview that puts whites on the bottom is a lot closer to a worldview that puts whites on the top than an egalitarian worldview is to either). Liberalism (i.e., treating people as individuals instead of identical constituents of their race) has been the driving force behind the massive reduction of white supremacy and anti-minority racism; it&#x27;s an enormous success and an important bulwark that protects minorities. Why should we erode this important bulwark by replacing it with a system that (1) perpetuates injustice against whites and (2) paves the way for white supremacy? Racism is lose-lose.",

Instead, we have some &quot;logical clusters&quot; of 3 nodes that we replicate reads and writes to, sharded to (currently) six clusters. Some logic around quorum for ensuring writes make it to at least 2&#x2F;3 nodes in a given cluster, with some optimizations for reads sometimes only needing 1 node to respond. We had to do a bunch of tweaking around state and memory management, and all the details were in the docs, which was great. It does exactly what we need it to do, but it is more expensive to run, and we&#x27;ve not figured out a way to do this right in k8s. We don&#x27;t care for the cost model going forward for when we want this model serving 10x traffic (which is not pie in the sky, it is known actual volume this solution would need to support). For 10x traffic, we&#x27;d be looking at 10x node count. At nearly 200 redis nodes, that can get expensive, esp. if we want to move to a managed solution. Anyway, not sure where I was going with this. Yes, redis can scale. Yes it can stay performant. At some point, it just becomes a lot to manage though and costs can add up. We are going to be designing a new solution to keep costs low and performance high.",

You should figure out some approximation of your data types and request profiles, and use those to get a rough understanding of what one Redis server on a given machine class is capable of delivering. This usually means applying a few different classes of read&#x2F;write loads against a small cluster at steadily increasing RPS, and documenting how CPU, memory, and latency characteristics change. From these numbers it&#x27;s possible to derive a capacity plan.<p>The last time I did this, for my workload and machine class, one Redis instance (one core) delivered 250-500k RPS, invariant to memory used. We&#x27;d use the conservative end of that range, combined with the RPS and data set growth rates we predicted, to provision for ~12 months of growth. Operationally, we would deploy (cores-1) or (cores-2) instances per host (I forget exactly) on 32- and 64-core machines. I think they had like 64-128G of RAM, and we made sure to leave enough memory overhead so the AOF or whatever persistence option wouldn&#x27;t lock up the box. But even the choices of what class of machines to use is a function of your use case, if you have really large dataset with relatively non-costly (CPU) operations, you want a totally different machine profile than a relatively small dataset with complex operations. Availability SLOs also factor in.<p>All of this is basic operational stuff, and with Redis the answers are pretty well-understood and highly predictable. Completely opposite to systems like Elasticsearch, which was a total nightmare to predict, provision for, and operate.",

People need to realize that a large engineering backlog has a lot of negative effects on the SDLC (&amp; velocity) as a whole. I wish more people would embrace heavy-handed WIP limits, even for backlog.<p>But, since backlog is now the primary output of &quot;product orgs&quot; at many (less-than-great) companies, you now have an entire org whose jobs depend on not learning that lesson.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the answer is, but I really am starting to hate this entire &quot;product org&quot; concept in general. It feels like we used to be able to just engineer our way around many of these challenges (&quot;here, look what I built last week to justify my case&quot;), or just get people into a room and talking. But once the decision channels become explicitly siloed off into a separate org with <i>C-Suite-level</i> autonomy, I&#x27;m not sure how you effectively bridge the gaps that form.<p>Any engineers who feel like having a separate product org has been a benefit to your company&#x27;s product quality and delivery speed want to comment on how you see this sort of thing working effectively?",

In Scrum, there are ideally two <i>completely separate queues</i>: The product backlog belongs to the business folks, and is organized in a way that works for them, and the dev team&#x27;s list of tasks belongs to dev, and probably shouldn&#x27;t look similar at all. And the only way for things to move from one queue to the other is during a regular meeting where the dev team says, &quot;OK, it looks like we&#x27;ve got room to take on X additional work, what can you give us?&quot;<p>And then, and I think this is secretly one of the most important things, the dev team <i>physically creates new tickets</i> for the new work they&#x27;re taking on. You should never be able to just drag-and-drop tickets from one queue to the other. Ideally, it shouldn&#x27;t even be physically possible to do so. Where I am right now, one is in $JIRA_COMPETITOR, and the other is an Excel spreadsheet. (If we all worked out of the same office, I&#x27;d probably go for an Excel spreadsheet and yellow sticky notes on a wall. Yellow sticky notes on a wall are awesome. They&#x27;re a great deterrent to keep the PHBs from generating reports and dashboards for bothering people with KPIs.)<p>This little ceremony, and the associated firewall between two related but separate business functions, is, I think the heart and soul of what Scrum <i>should</i> be. It&#x27;s the thing that sets up all the little firewalls and incentives that encourage business and dev to maintain a relationship that&#x27;s more functional than dysfunctional. Everything else - sprints, story points, standup meetings, all that jazz - is just window dressing that some teams may or may not find makes that ceremony go more smoothly.<p>And if you can get a formal handoff like that in place, and get people to respect it, my (admittedly hopelessly idealistic) belief is that the rest of it gets easier to figure out. What&#x27;s the correct scope and size of individual requests that the product people make of the dev team? Whatever size and scope best enables people to come out of the meeting feeling good about how it went.<p>But if everything&#x27;s being jammed into one gimongous ticketing system, like all the ticketing system vendors seem to want you to do, you&#x27;re doomed.",

What has ever been wrong with that? It seems to me like, in a lot of cases, engineers just lost their nerve in terms of confidently talking to sales people and the business side of the company, and couldn&#x27;t deal with the (imo, healthy) tension any more. I understand that people want estimates and timelines and stuff like that, and those are totally reasonable. But flagellating ourselves over absurdly small timelines, and hand-wringing over tiny pieces of features of projects as the core driver for engineering productivity, just seems crazy to me. It seems a lot more like purely signalling to the business side some vague ideas about &quot;commitment,&quot; or &quot;hustle,&quot; or whatever without having to speak to &quot;those obnoxious sales people.&quot;",

What is the difference in terms of confidence of estimates that can be given if you have 20 tasks in the backlog, versus 200. Sure, for that one thing you can up the priority and jam it in above a bunch of other stuff.

        "text": "25+ years of working in software engineering has taught me that &quot;issue tracker&quot; presents the wrong metaphor. This product looks like it&#x27;s not providing any novel improvements on what has failed for everyone so far, other than a slightly shinier surface.<p>Clearly there&#x27;s utility to issue tracking: Projects have problems of various kinds (bugs, mostly) that need to be fixed. Sometimes these are conflated with tasks, which are things that people need to do, but those are not the same. Sometimes these are also conflated with &quot;support tickets&quot; from consumers&#x2F;customers.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t having a &quot;database of problems&quot;. Clearly that&#x27;s useful: If I use a program, and it doesn&#x27;t work in some way, being able to look this information up somewhere is useful, both as a way to confirm that the problem exists for other people, and to follow up on it, and as a way to potentially find an existing solution.<p>But issue trackers aren&#x27;t mostly used for that. They&#x27;re used to drive development, and in that sense, this model doesn&#x27;t accurately represent the fundamental relationships and power dynamics between people and technology. Issue trackers rot and become unusable piles of cruft very quickly because they&#x27;re just &quot;databases&quot;, and not a process. Databases must be maintained; they model real-life information that becomes out of date almost the moment it&#x27;s entered. Of course, an organization <i>can</i> use issue trackers successfully, but it requires a very rigid process that constantly follows up, and you end up with a top-heavy social process that mostly (ab)uses a database to keep notes about progress.<p>I&#x27;m a fan of action-oriented task management, based on the principle that if something isn&#x27;t painful (poses a roadblock to development, for example) or risky (may cause a customer to leave, for example), then it&#x27;s not worth entering into a centralized database. Project-level task management should be oriented around stakeholders: Whoever an issue is important to should own it and keep it alive.<p>For example, a project manager can keep a spreadsheet or whatever of what people are working on, and their job is assigning work and making sure things get done, that the work follows some development timeline, and that the upstream stakeholders are satisfied. Nobody downstream needs to see this spreadsheet, but the project manager may need to present it upstream. By doing this, you&#x27;re essentially rate-limiting your issue&#x2F;task flow, and ensuring that someone keeps what&#x27;s important alive. If something slips through the cracks and nobody complains, it wasn&#x27;t important enough to remember.<p>A simple document (Google Docs, a wiki, markdown files on Github, etc.) of &quot;known issues&quot; can be used by developers and certain customers&#x2F;clients to understand deficiencies. It&#x27;s going to grow stale fast anyway, so prepare for it. Keep it loose and let it rot, and use it as a springboard for ideas in the future (if you bother to ever look at it again). Whenever possible, describe known issues in code so that you can look for TODO comments; that way, they won&#x27;t go out of sync so easily.<p>For <i>clients</i> of your project&#x2F;product, have a support channel (&quot;ticket system&quot;). This is not a database, but a communication tool. Open tickets mean there&#x27;s a stakeholder waiting at the other end that may not be serviced fully (even if your project doesn&#x27;t have a formal SLA). Making it public allows people to discover existing problems and find solutions to problems people had in the past. Support channels shouldn&#x27;t just be for external clients. I think a lot of companies could improve their communications by having internal ones, too.<p>I think a lot of people understand this, yet it feels liberating to put their backlog in a database, because it <i>seems</i> like something that&#x27;s ideal for a database. Developers love building task systems; it&#x27;s such a simple data model that seems to neatly organize real-life concerns. But it&#x27;s also a model that doesn&#x27;t scale to more than a handful of issues, and doesn&#x27;t really match how people work and communicate.<p>At the same time, it may feel <i>risky</i> to forego an issue tracker. But there are plenty of large projects that are managed without one. PostgreSQL, for example, doesn&#x27;t have an issue tracker, and bugs are managed entirely through mailing list discussions, and they&#x27;re doing great.",

It just shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;database&quot;-oriented. For example, I&#x27;m a bigger believer in process (than issue trackers and so on), and I think there are better ways to support the processes.<p>For example, <i>why</i> does a program have bugs? Whenever a bug comes around, try to systematize it. Was it because tests didn&#x27;t exist? Was the bug caused by an vendor API and not your own? Sloppy programming? Etc. Collecting and measuring can uncover systemic issues. For example, you may eventually realize that 80% of bugs could have been avoided with tests. The only way to get better is to measure and record. But issue trackers like Github and Bugzilla don&#x27;t help you with that.<p>Same thing with support systems. If you collate data about support tickets you can start to understand why you&#x27;re getting support tickets in the first place. It&#x27;s not rocket science, yet it appears rare.",

You don&#x27;t have that person inside your organization, so that&#x27;s they need a channel into your process. A support ticket needs to be triaged, prioritized, and executed, but that belongs in project management land.<p>I guess the overarching idea of my philosophy is that all pieces of a company&#x27;s workings need to be owned by someone. Software like issue trackers don&#x27;t work because you can&#x27;t replace ownership with software. You may pretend that all issues going into the system are important, but they aren&#x27;t, which is how we have ended up with Github bots that go around closing &quot;stale&quot; issues.<p>Thanks for reminding me about Bors.

But\u2026<p>When I first learned about the OmegaWiki project (called WiktionaryZ then, I think), I was thrilled. It tried to represent lexical (Wiktionary) definitions and other language concepts using data. For each sense of each word, a so called DefinedMeaning was created. In the same sense, Wikidata has its entities. But soon, I learned about a problematic aspect of OmegaWiki\u2019s concept, and the same thing appears on Wikidata: You represent some set of concepts in a single language, then another language comes and needs to split some concepts in two, because your language uses one word for both, but the other differentiates between them. Then, a third language comes and it maps its concepts to your existing set still a bit differently, so you might get four entities for just three languages. Etc.<p>On Wikidata, more focus is, I guess, on \u201cconcrete\u201d entities: people, places, etc., where this does not appear that often. But it contains the abstract entities as well, and the problem appears there all the time. You might try to \u201cfix\u201d the problematic entities by splitting them to more elementary, linked using \u201csubclass of\u201d etc.; in some cases it might work quite fine (but losing the interwiki links in the process, which is unfortunate, given those were the original use case of Wikidata), in others, it is basically impossible without a degree in philosophy and deep understanding of ten languages, to be able to correctly distinguish and represent their relations. And imagine somebody trying to _use_ those entities. Like \u201cI would like to say this person was a writer\u201d, but there are seventeen entities with the English label of \u201cwriter\u201d, distinguished by some obscure difference used by a group of Sino-Tibetan languages.<p>And\u2026 Wikidata entities represent basically just nouns.<p>So\u2026 I am a bit sceptical.",

Unfortunately COVID changed the plans but we were really really impressed with the capabilities.<p>Semantic web is used broadly; Google Structured data you see for reviews and infoboxes, wikidata. Data is broadly available, even if jobs in semantic technologies are not.<p>We&#x27;re familiar with common databases like key value stores, OLAP, OLTP, but reasoning technology offers unique properties many people aren&#x27;t aware of. For example you can have your business logic integrated with your database in a way that&#x27;s much more flexible that stored procedures. You express your business rules as logic programs, the automatically run multi-core, they run as soon as data is inserted into the database and there is no function call; the data does not need to be aware of what logic is in the database, logical rules are applied incrementally so that adding new data or new rules does not trigger re-computation of all the data, business rules can use data produced by other business rules, and finally you use the explain command to get a mathematical proof of why an outcome happened.<p>Reasoning technology may be old but recently this idea of automatically stating things in a declarative form and having the application reconcile the differences has been the differentiating factor for the most popular software out there; kubernetes, teraform, ansible, react, graphql, flutter. Without the declarative reasoning capabilities, these tools may not be considered some of the best.<p>Think postgresql 12 generated columns except infinitely chainable, recursive and connectable to other tables. Think pre-computed materialized views, but automatically updated as new data is inserted (no refresh needed).",

In fact the whole architecture reminds me a lot of IBM&#x27;s Watson - the good bits (i.e. the Prolog stuff they used to store the knowledgebase).<p>________<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2004.04733.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2004.04733.pdf</a>",

        "text": "Hi, founder of Diffbot here, we are an AI research company spinout from Stanford that generate the world&#x27;s largest knowledge graph from crawling the whole web. I didn&#x27;t want to comment, but I see a lot of misunderstandings here about knowledge graphs, abstract representations of language, and the extent as to which this project uses ML.<p>First of all, having a machine-readable database of knowledge(i.e. Wikidata) is no doubt a great thing.  It&#x27;s maintained by a large community of human curators and always growing. However, generating actually useful natural language that rivals the value you get from reading a Wikipedia page from an abstract representation is problematic.<p>If you look at the walkthrough for how this would work (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;google&#x2F;abstracttext&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;eneyj&#x2F;docs&#x2F;walkthrough.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;google&#x2F;abstracttext&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;eneyj&#x2F;doc...</a>), this project does not use machine and uses CFG-like production rules to generate natural sentences. Works great for generating toy sentences like &quot;X is a Y&quot;.<p>However, human languages are not programming languages. Many natural languages, like German and Finnish, are so syntactically and morphologically complex that there is no compact ruleset that can describe them. (those that have taken grammar class can relate to the number of exceptions to the ruleset)<p>Additionally, not every sentence in a typical Wikipedia article can be easily represented in a machine-readable factual format. Plenty of text is opinion, subjective, or describes notions that don&#x27;t have an proper entity. Of course there are ways that engineer around this, however they will exponential grow the complexity of your ontology, number of properties, and make for a terrible user experience for the annotators.<p>A much better and direct approach to the stated intention of making the knowledge accessible to more readers is to advance the state of machine translation, which would capture nuance and non-facts present in the original article.  Additionally, exploring ML-based ways of NL generation from the dataset this will produce will have academic impact.",

The goal doesn&#x27;t seem to be to have all Wikipedia articles generated from Wikidata, but rather to have a couple of templates to the order of &quot;if I have this data available about this type of Subject, generate this stub article about it&quot;. That would allow the smaller Wikipedia language editions to automatically generate many baseline articles that they might not currently have.<p>For example, the Dutch Wikipedia is one of the largest editions mainly because a large percentage of its articles were created by bots [1] that created a lot of articles on small towns (&quot;x is a town in the municipality of y, founded in z. It is nearby m, n and o.&quot;) and obscure species of plants. This just seems like a more structured plan to apply that approach to many of the smaller Wikipedia&#x27;s that may be missing a lot of basic articles and are thus not exposing many basic facts.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dutch_Wikipedia#Internet_bots\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dutch_Wikipedia#Internet_bots</a>",

A reader finds an article they are interested in and then asks\nthe service to translate itinto a language they understand. Google Translate\ncurrently supports about a hundred languages \u2014 about a third of thelanguages\nWikipedia supports. Also the quality of these translations can vary widely \u2014 and\nalmost never achieves thequality a reader expects from an encyclopedia [33,\n86].*<p><i>Unfortunately, the quality of the translations often correlates with the\navailability of content in the given language [1],which leads to a Matthew\neffect: languages that already have larger amounts of content also feature\nbetter results intranslation.

            "text": "&gt;&gt; Many natural languages, like German and Finnish, are so syntactically and\nmorphologically complex that there is no compact ruleset that can describe\nthem.<p>Is that realy true? If natural languages have rules, then there exists a\nruleset that can describe any natural language- the set of all rules in that\nlanguage. Of course, a &quot;rule&quot; is a compact representation of a set of strings,\nso if natural languages don&#x27;t have such rules it&#x27;s difficult to see how <i>any</i>\nautomated system can represent a natural language &quot;compactly&quot;. A system\nwithout any kind of &quot;rules&quot; would have to store every grammatical string in a\nlanguage. That must be impossible in theory and in practice.<p>If I may offer a personal perspective, I think that the goal of the plan is to\nproduce better automated translations than is currently possible with machine\ntranslation between language pairs for which there are very few parallel\ntexts. My personal perspective is that I&#x27;m Greek and I am sad to report that\nbasicaly translation from any language to Greek by e.g. Google Translate\n(which I use occasionally) is laughably, cringe-inducingly bad. From what I\nunderstand the reason for that is not only the morphology of the Greek\nlanguage which is kind of a linguistic isolate (as opposed to, say, Romance\nlanguages), but also that, because there are not many parallel texts between\nmost languages (on Google Translate) and Greek, the translation goes through\nEnglish- which results in completely distorted syntax and meaning. Any project\nthat can improve on this sorry state of affairs (and not just for Greek- there\nare languages with many fewer speakers and no paralle texts at all, not even\nwith English) is worth every second of its time.<p>To put it plainly, if you don&#x27;t have enough data to train a machine learning\nmodel, what, exactly, are your options? There is only one option: to do the\nwork by hand. Wikipedia, with its army of volunteers, has a much better shot\nat getting results this way than any previous effort.",

The creators are attempting to address this by actually containing every single aspect of a movie&#x27;s plot as a fact, and that sentences are functions that express those facts... but this seems entirely unwieldy and just too much work.<p>What I&#x27;ve wished for instead, for years, is actually an underlying &quot;metalanguage&quot; that expresses the vocabulary and grammatical concepts in <i>all</i> languages. Very loosely, think of an &quot;intermediate&quot; linguistic representation layer in Google Translate.<p>Obviously nobody can write in that directly in a user-friendly way. But what you <i>could</i> do is take English (or any language) text, do an automated translation into that intermediate representation, then ask the author or volunteers to <i>identify</i> all ambiguous language cases&quot; -- e.g. it would ask if &quot;he signed&quot; means made his signature, or communicated in sign language. It would also ask for things that would need clarification perhaps not in your own language but in other languages -- e.g. what noun does &quot;it&quot; refer to, so another language will know to use the masculine or feminine version. All of this can be done <i>within your own language</i> to produce an accurate language-agnostic &quot;text&quot;.<p><i>Then</i>, out of this intermediate canonical interpretation, <i>every</i> article on Wikipedia would be generated back out of it, in <i>all</i> languages, and <i>perfectly</i> accurately, because the output program isn&#x27;t even ML, it&#x27;s just a straight-up rule engine.<p>Interestingly, an English-language original might be output just a little bit different but in ways that don&#x27;t change the meaning. Almost like a language &quot;linter&quot;.<p>Anyways -- I think it would actually be doable. The key part is a &quot;Google Translate&quot;-type tool that does 99% of the work. It would need manual curation of the intermediate layer with a professional linguist from each language, as well as manually curated output rules (although those could be generated by ML as a first pass).<p>But something like that could fundamentally change communication. Imagine if any article you wanted to make available perfectly translated to anyone, you could do, just with the extra work of resolving all the ambiguities a translating program finds.",

What I&#x27;m talking about is quite different, though.<p>Leibniz&#x27;s proposal and similar ones are about a language intended to represent knowledge (formal concepts), and usable by people (with training).<p>I&#x27;m talking about simply a translation layer. It doesn&#x27;t &quot;know&quot; or symbolize anything on its own -- it&#x27;s merely a central mapping between all constructs in different languages. Nobody would read or write in it directly, and it couldn&#x27;t be used to make inferences or anything like that.<p>What Abstract Wikipedia is proposing is actually quite similar to what Leibniz proposed, an intricately detailed map of knowledge and true propositions.<p>What I&#x27;m proposing is vastly less ambitious and vastly more useful: just a way to store the meaning of text in an intermediate representation that belongs to no single language. But that representation doesn&#x27;t bother with what are facts or propositions or anything like that -- just entities and relations that mapped to however we ultimately understand languages in the real world. And assisted with a ton of ML, rather than built up from elementary propositions or set theory or something.",

You might not even have to define a representation of the metalanguage, you could just keep a set of (phrase, score) tuples, and interpolate translations of those phrases into the target language at display time! that almost sounds practical to me",

The &quot;fall apart&quot; part comes from the fact that conspiracy theories rely on hidden, unsubstantiated, subjective interpretations of intent or actions whose validity can be questioned.  If they are key pillars of the narrative, then their falsity can negate the truth of the narrative.<p>This reminds me of a philosophical discussion around what &quot;truth&quot; means.  Coherent theory of truth: truth is defined as a property that&#x27;s coherent among a set of beliefs.  It can also be used as an epistemic justification -- that is, any set of internally consistent beliefs can be taken as true.  Of course, in practice, certain truth statements have to correspond to reality, which is where the correspondence theory of truth comes in.",

It garbles meaning a majority of the time, and in a significant minority of cases destroys meaning completely.<p>To me the idea that you could translate an encyclopedia, where accuracy of meaning is critical, using such technology in its current state is horrifying. By contrast the abstract&#x2F;semantic approach seems to have some potential, although I can&#x27;t imagine it working well for all articles.",

I believe this was when we did the great www -&gt; www2 migration, which was of course supposed to be temporary. In fact I think that was when we migrated from our own datacentre to AOL&#x27;s but I could be getting the timing wrong.<p>Back then it was served from a Sun E4500 running Solaris (7?) and Netscape Enterprise Server. Netscape had been acquired by AOL which had also just bought Time Warner (that&#x27;s why we moved to their datacentre) but somehow we couldn&#x27;t make the internal accounting work and still had to buy server licenses.<p>Fun fact, unlike Apache, NES enabled the HTTP DELETE method out of the box and it had to be disabled in your config. We found that out the hard way when one of the sysadmins ran a vulnerability scanner which deleted all the websites. We were forbidden from running scans again by management.<p>Another fun fact about NES - they were really pushing server side Javascript as the development language for the web (and mostly losing to mod_perl). Also back in 2001 but at a different place I worked with the person who had just written a book on server side js for O&#x27;Reilly - he got his advance but they didn&#x27;t publish it because by the time he had finished it they considered it a &quot;dead technology&quot;.<p>Our job was basically to maintain an enormous config file for the webserver which was 99% redirects because they would buy every conceivable domain name for a movie which would all redirect to the canonical one. Famously they couldn&#x27;t get a hold of matrix.com and had to use whatisthematrix.com. Us sysadmins ran our own IRC server and &quot;302&quot; was shorthand for &quot;let&#x27;s go&quot; - &quot;302 to a meeting&quot;. &quot;302&quot; on its own was &quot;lunchtime&quot;.<p>I still mention maintaining this site on my CV and LinkedIn - disappointingly I&#x27;ve never been asked about it in an interview. I suspect most of the people doing the interviewing these days are too young to remember it.",

Just had a quick look at some js based versions looks like it&#x27;s got a bit faster, but still slow.<p>[1] Awesome performance, super hard for others to understand the code.

Changes would be ordered, and the cycle repeated.<p>The scene where the &quot;talent&quot; is being sucked out of players had problems with the &quot;slime&quot; effect.

They could have used a cookie (supported in Mosaic since around 1994), or used a server-side session (I think was cgi::session a thing back then). That was a technical decision someone made. Those sorts of choices when you&#x27;re speccing a web app haven&#x27;t changed.<p>These days it would be a bit unusual to use routing to store the game state admittedly but that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s good to have older devs like 43-year-old me on the team. I actually think about these sorts of details rather than using the defaults.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that storing the state in the URL shouldn&#x27;t be the default. Being able to see the state by reading the address bar would be a security issue for most apps.",

With all respect, the personal home page is not a private expression; it&#x27;s a public billboard that people work on to say what they&#x27;re interested in. That&#x27;s not as interesting to me as people using it in their private lives. It&#x27;s exhibitionism, if you like. Or self-expression. It&#x27;s openness, and it&#x27;s great in a way, it&#x27;s people letting the community into their homes. But it&#x27;s not really their home. They may call it a home page, but it&#x27;s more like the gnome in somebody&#x27;s front yard than the home itself. People don&#x27;t have the tools for using the Web for their homes, or for organizing their private lives; they don&#x27;t really put their scrapbooks on the Web. They don&#x27;t have family Webs. There are many distributed families nowadays, especially in the high-tech fields, so it would be quite reasonable to do that, yet I don&#x27;t know of any. One reason is that most people don&#x27;t have the ability to publish with restricted access.&quot;<p>Basically was describing the concept of social networks before they existed on the web.",

There&#x27;s fancy bundling and twisting and whatever involved, but it&#x27;s still ultimately just conductive wires.<p>When did cables start getting chips, and why? Did Apple start it or somebody else? Is it solely to try to prevent third-party manufacturers? Is it for the cable to announce to the port that it supports certain specifications of power or data? (But why would that require a chip instead of just some kind of &quot;dumb&quot; extra pin that has some basic electrical property that can be read?) Is it something else?<p>I mean I understand why certain <i>dongles</i> have chips, because they&#x27;re connecting between sets of pins that aren&#x27;t 1-1 or even in the same data format at all. Or why the same might be true for USB-C to Lightning.<p>But for cables to go from &quot;dumb&quot; to &quot;smart&quot; seems like it kind of breaks all expectations of what a cable even does, and therefore how a consumer will even know what to purchase -- which, of course, has famously been a HUGE issue with USB-C.<p>Would it be better for us to go back to dumb cables without chips? Or are there good reasons why this is the future, where at some point we&#x27;ll expect <i>all</i> computer cables to have them?",

This power may is electrical power in terms of voltages with defined generated current or in terms of current with defined voltages (20mA communication heavily seen in industrial equipment). If you have a slow communication link, EMI and other environmental thinks like temperature is not much of an issue. But as faster you like to communicate you need to cope with those things. The electrical contacts in the connectors doesn&#x27;t help. So people started to put the transceivers into the cables. Those transceivers with additional electronics like ringing suppression circuitry and other &quot;magic&quot; are then best fitted for the desired cables for the desired environments. Then you started to makes those cables smart like to detect the capabilities of the cables like is it really possible to talk at 10Gbps or is it more a cheaper type where 100Mbps is the max. As more smarter those cables get people get creative to put other things in it like &quot;hey, the cable could become a converter as well&quot;.",

Tell that the people, who want to connect a stick drive to offload their videos. Tell that the people who provide different accessories.<p>Lighting has evolved from the 30-pin Dock connector. The 30-pin Dock connector was the idea to combine charging, USB, and some analog stuff into one single connector. At that time USB provided only 5V and 200mA. Apple was one of the other who improved USB charging by allowing more power. But for the sake of compatibility, you cannot just do this, you need to negotiate it. It is like every USB up to USB3 starts in USB1.1 to negotiate the possibilities.<p>So, Lighting was not developed out of thin air. It was developed with a history, like many many other communication protocols and standards. Even as Apple is known for cutting of old ties easily, if you look really deep into the details, you will always find compatibility to old out-dated technologies. Its like you still find the good old 8051-core in many things, like even dead simple and cheap charge controllers.",

This could be interpreted by the person on the other end as a sign to reset what was going on and start again, or really anything that might have been pre-agreed.<p>With the advent of computing, and connecting teletypes to computers, it was often used to trigger an NMI.  Multics and the rainbow books cited it as a way to make sure you were talking to the \u201creal computer and not some program impersonating your computer (since it wasn\u2019t an actual character there was no way for a normal program to even <i>see</i> it much less generate it. The terminal controller&#x2F;channel controller could see it though and notify the monitor (what we call the \u201ckernel\u201d these days).",

The cost&#x2F;quality of the cables they package in phones matters to them a lot. They don&#x27;t care a ton if additional cables sell well or not. And you&#x27;re absolutely correct that many people will buy Apple official cables just because they&#x27;re Apple official.<p>But here&#x27;s the thing: Apple can&#x27;t go selling premium cables and including cheapy ones in their phone boxes. The Apple brand has to be viewed as premium all the time, so they put a mediocre cable both in the box and sold on their website.",

I mean by this that it could be considered as going out of their way to make sure there are no tight bends, not pulling on cables, not shoving the cable in a purse whichever way you can, etc. My original iphone cable I bought more than 3 years ago still has its rounded shape as when it was new.<p>This, combined with poor quality products explains the difference in my opinion.<p>The only cable that frayed on me was a MagSafe 2, next to the computer connector. The cable is ridiculously thin. It was the adapter for my 15 MBP. In comparison, I&#x27;m still using the original adapter of my 2008 MBP and apart from being scratched and dirty, it&#x27;s still as good as new, cable and all.<p>What I think happens often is that the cable will be under some kind of rotational stress. I&#x27;ve noticed I have a tendency to always turn the phone the same way, so the cable has a tendency to turn around its axis. It&#x27;s something I see especially often on corded office phones. Also, cables are often at very tight angles close to the connector, so there beign next to no relief ends up tearing the housing.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen many people pull on the cable instead of the connector to uplug it. That can&#x27;t be to good for longevity either.",

As a warranty tech I was doing this multiple times a day and it could be done in under ten minutes fairly easily. While the repair was of course free for warranty and service plan customers it was very inexpensive (relatively) for non-warranty customers, less than $50 if I recall correctly and that was due to a labor minimum, the part was only a few dollars as billed. Unfortunately even Lenovo has dropped this practice in the course of reducing case sizes and later switching to USB-C.<p>Of course this was also back when we made such a deal of turnaround time we used to call a taxi courier to deliver warranty units back to corporate customers with the higher end service plans. I&#x27;m not sure that you can get this kind of service any more with any vendor without using some small local VAR. I remember vehemently apologizing to electrical utility linemen that we didn&#x27;t have a part in stock and so they wouldn&#x27;t get their T50 back until we got the replacement in the next morning.<p>Perhaps part of this is compensated for by improved longevity in newer cables, but cycle life is rarely the problem (except perhaps on the iffier miniUSB), instead it&#x27;s dropped&#x2F;kicked&#x2F;dragged devices. In general I am pretty frustrated with the decrease in serviceability of devices but this one is especially irritating, since like most people I&#x27;ve had a lot of devices where the charging port failed before everything else. USB-C feels like it represents a step back in a lot of ways because it&#x27;s basically put the kibosh on magnetic charging interfaces (even more so than patents).",

In practice, though, it&#x27;s often used for USB HDDs, and often those drives couldn&#x27;t function reliably with the power levels of a USB 2 connection, so using them with a USB 2 micro connector was not only much slower, but they&#x27;d just power down randomly.<p>I like lightning connector, but it too has it&#x27;s silly hacks.  The HDMI dongles are an amazing level of silliness, down to a slimmed down iOS image being copied to the dongle and run there to enable a h264 decoder to run on the dongle itself.

I think it&#x27;s a conversation worth having, so I&#x27;m putting it at the top level instead.]\nI&#x27;d argue that &quot;intellectual property&quot; is fundamentally different from physical property, and can&#x27;t really be &quot;stolen&quot; per se.<p>If I steal your car, I have a car and you don&#x27;t have a car. If I &quot;steal&quot; your book, we both have the book. I&#x27;m better off, and you&#x27;re no worse off. In an &quot;ideal&quot; society, the free sharing of knowledge would be not just allowed, but encouraged.<p>I imagine there&#x27;s been measurable harm to our society&#x27;s cultural and scientific advancement because copyright forces us to recreate others&#x27; work instead of building off of it.<p>But what does that world look like? Quite frankly, I&#x27;m not sure. Of course, we can&#x27;t just abolish copyright with no replacement; it&#x27;s certainly necessary to reward the creation of this work somehow.<p>One thing I&#x27;ve thought about is a sort of &quot;crowdfunded patronage&quot; model, where the creator of a work declares upfront how much money they want to make off of it, and releases it into the public domain once they&#x27;ve received that much money.<p>Another possibility is drastically reducing the term of copyright to 20 years or so. That&#x27;d still give 20 years to exploit the work\u2014and I imagine most copyrighted works make most of their money in the first 20 years\u2014while allowing others to reuse the work much more quickly.",

            "text": "Most people support copyright because they think content creators should be rewarded for their work. Unfortunately, the copyright laws that we have do much more than that, and that&#x27;s a problem.<p>I support minimalist copyright laws, where for a set period of time (shorter than current copyright) an author&#x2F;creator is the only person who can <i>profit</i> from work. For instance, an author publishes a book, and for 10 years is the only person able to sell copies, sell the manuscript to a publisher, etc.<p>But after 10 years, that book is essentially public knowledge. It&#x27;s been out there, maybe some people have memorised portions of it, it&#x27;s been read in a library far more times than it&#x27;s been purchased, etc. At that point, I see no societal benefit to maintaining copyright. My own moral framework does not require an author to be rewarded indefinitely for their creative work (imagine if a builder and their estate received royalties every time somebody entered a building they constructed for 70 years? Absurd.)<p>I also have a huge problem with creative &quot;rights&quot;. Take Harry Potter as an example. Everybody knows about Harry Potter, anybody could tell you the story, some people could probably reproduce a very rough abridged version from memory. It is part of our culture, cannon, consciousness, whatever. It&#x27;s popular.<p>Now, if I want to make a Harry Potter game, or write a play, or do a live dramatisation, etc, I owe JK royalties. That to me is not fair. She has been rewarded for her work many times over. The ideas and the characters are now in everybody&#x27;s minds. We know them. If I want to adapt them or discuss them through a creative work, I should be free to do so.<p>I often use the example of Ancient Greece to explain this. Almost all the written stories and poems we have from that time are simply written versions of stories told aurally. The Illyiyd as we have it is just one version that somebody wrote down of possibly hundreds of spoken versions that existed at the time. The Greek plays were part of their culture and were freely shared. Anybody could build on them, change them, and referencing them in new works was an honor to the original creator (if they were even known). It is very sad that the West has now favored infinite profit (I.E. copyright that lasts a lifetime) over the spreading of ideas and the sharing of common cultural references freely.",

Yes, there are indie films, and indie creators. They&#x27;re all over YouTube. But big budget AAA effects cost money, and somebody has to pay for them. There has to be an incentive to create this content that is monetary.<p>Now, I am personally in favour of reeling back copyright to only protect the profiting off of work (i.e. only the original creator can <i>sell</i> copies of their work for a limited period of time), but anybody is free to reproduce without profit. And then after x period of time (10 years for instance), anybody is free to also sell it or use it in commercial works&#x2F;adaptations.<p>I see no societal benefit to content creators being rewarded in perpetuity. You wrote a great book? Cool, you can profit from it for 10 years as a reward for your work. After that, you can make money doing speaking tours, or interviews, etc. Guaranteeing royalties for a book that I can go and borrow from a library, or for a film I can go watch at a friends place, for longer than around 10 years does not make any sense.",

            "text": "I think the dilemma is more important than how we do the copyright laws right now. Sharing is always better as a model, it demands less restrictions for one, less oversight. I don&#x27;t have a number how much the world population have grown since the laws were inacted, but it&#x27;s at least in the 10 fold? What works on a &quot;small&quot; number of people might not scale. We as programmers know that. So what gives if everyone wants to be a millionare, which in a sense promotes that ignoring values&#x2F;others around is a good idea if you yourself get a good life. In an ironic twist the most shared idea is the one that anyone could be rich, and that it is a good thing to be much richer than those around you.<p>So, what is a good life? I don&#x27;t see living in a mansion or castle as a good way of life if measured that way. I rather see it how many people I can help along during my stay here, that&#x27;s my measurement. Of course I absolutely hate copyright and the notion of IP.<p>Maybe the laws and lengths are good for the life views that people have right now. But maybe there&#x27;s other incentives than the Right to the work, maybe good work could be measured in an other sense and rewarded more directly in your community. Globalisation when done badly is so bad for us since the ones in that bubble optimize for their own profit instead of the greater good (which is the best scenario in long sight).<p>Maybe I&#x27;m weird, but I am soo tired of the idea that we should only focus on ourselves all the time. Get good ideas out that will solve big problem, reward those that produce those ideas and those that want to do the miles. Less of the, look I changed color of this thing and now I got a patent on it and I will sue you. Reward ideas that makes sharing easier. We as a planet just don&#x27;t have the time if we want to make it as a whole.",

My model is extremely simplified so it would fit into a comment, but it doesn&#x27;t need to be that simple for the general idea to hold.<p>Suppose you pirated a thousand games and would&#x27;ve legitimately purchased one. Your piracy then represents a theft of one game. Since there&#x27;s no way to tell which one game you would&#x27;ve bought, we could simplify it to say that stole one one thousandth of a game from each publisher (assuming they were all unique publishers).<p>In reality, I think it&#x27;s really hard to know what you would&#x27;ve done without access to piracy. It&#x27;s almost certainly not &quot;buy all the games&quot; but it&#x27;s also probably not &quot;buy zero games&quot;.<p>I also pirated a lot of things when I was in college - partly because it was cheaper, and I was very cheap, and partly because it was easier than actually getting some things. One thing I try to do is separate my own personal bias (it can&#x27;t be bad because I did it) from what seems like the clear harm and moral reasoning I laid out above. You&#x27;re taking from the publishers, even if only small values, and if everyone did what you did, publishing couldn&#x27;t exist as a business.<p>I think it makes sense that poor people would steal more frequently. They need to. It also makes sense that younger people would steal more frequently - they are less mature, think less about others, and less about the consequences. Given that, it doesn&#x27;t surprise me that you and I both pirated more while younger. That said, even though it makes sense, that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s right.",

If you release a creative work into the wild (i.e. publish it), then you have taken the risk that others will photocopy it, write it down word for word on a piece of paper, memorise it, be inspired by it and have a better more profitable idea, etc. Nobody can compel you to release work you&#x27;ve created, but once you release it then you&#x27;ve let it go.<p>Now, our society has decided that in order to give an incentive for people to buy books, we will make it illegal to copy books. That is arbitrary, and purely an economic decision.<p>If I go to a library that holds your book and memorise it, have I stolen it? What if everybody who ever wanted to buy your work decided they&#x27;d rather just read it once at a library? Is it stolen? Of course not.<p>When you purchase a book, you are rewarding the publisher for their time and materials in physically producing the book. The author already made their profit when the publisher bought the rights off them. If a publisher wishes to enter into a royalties agreement instead, they do so at their own risk. Society should not protect the royalty system, which I believe is unfair compared to the flat-rate payment anyway. For smaller authors, a publisher will usually work out how many copies they think they can sell, and give the author an amount proportional to that. They then bare the risk of selling less, and are exposed to the opportunity of selling more. The author has received their reward, and the publisher must do their best to sell them.",

Value is not created, merely exchanged via fungible means. Just as I&#x27;m cheated out of DRM free hardware by collisions with industry by rights holders, so too are rights holders plagued by those who find ways around things.<p>I&#x27;d rather live in a world where useful information could flow freely. I&#x27;m still willing to compensate for something that genuinely entertains, enlightens, or helps me. That magnanimity goes down the hole once it turns into extortion.<p>And make no mistake, it always does. I&#x27;ve yet to see a significantly cheaper ebook than a paperback. Instead, I see them treated as roughly equivalent despite the sharp loss of utility of a DRM&#x27;d artifact.<p>Until that madness resolves, and I stop running into people who feel entitled to hypothetical sales, I see no reason to take rightholders as arguing at all in good faith.",

In the same way, I know you&#x27;ll disagree with me, and it&#x27;s hard for me to see how there is anything productive here.<p>Violating copyright takes potential sales. Those have value. For example, if you had a product worth X dollars, and people had a Y chance of buying it, you could sell the rights to your product based on that value.<p>Our society respects the concept of potential sales or potential value in many ways. If I lie and say that your restaurant is filled with rats, what am I costing you, if not potential sales?  I could sell options contracts that have potential value. If I break the fingers of a master pianist or a surgeon I may be sued for a greater amount of damages than if I broke the fingers of any professional who doesn&#x27;t need manual dexterity.<p>Potential value is the basis for lots of business and productive endeavors.

In an &quot;ideal&quot; society, the free sharing of knowledge would be not just allowed, but encouraged.<p>Up until now, the value of a book has been set by the author, and reinforced by scarcity. Entire large economic models and systems have been built by tying the two together. What is supply and demand, when supply is <i>infinite</i>?<p>Basically, the author puts in some amount of thought and labor writing a book, and they get rewarded by a purchase. Capitalism is heavily based on this: &quot;Labor results in production, production is rewarded by consumers, because they need to part with some money to benefit for the end result&quot;. The last item is no longer true, which has ripple effects all the way up the chain.<p>No wonder people want to bring back the economic models and systems of capitalism they&#x27;re familiar with, by enforcing scarcity -- thousands of years of societal and economic development might be upended by new technology.<p>Libraries have always been a thorn in the side of capitalism, but they&#x27;ve usually been constrained and limited enough that they aren&#x27;t a real threat. With the ease of digital copying, the seams are starting to tear much faster now.<p>Some want to dismantle copyright but keep the rest of the capitalist system in place, untouched, which I don&#x27;t really see as realistic. I think the two are much more closely linked than you might imagine. If we&#x27;re going to be overhauling the whole thing, we need to have systems in place for the huge societal impact it will have.<p>You fill in the rest of the dots for what new systems one might prefer over capitalism, and charting the course for what comes next, that can support people. At the very least, capitalism might just be on its way out.",

Often in debates (esp. Political) people will &quot;borrow&quot; their opposition&#x27;s words against their will with the intention of making them look stupid.<p>Most science involves working off other&#x27;s ideas, without the ideas originator&#x27;s consent (but attribution is required).<p>&gt; What are the general responsibilities of society?<p>That&#x27;s a heavy philosophical question, and answers will vary. Usually involves ensuring the administration of justice and having a monoply on violence. Sometimes providing basic neccesesities is included. People often do include enforcing physical property rights here (i have never heard of people including intellectual prop rights, although there probably are people who feel that way). In some communist states, the right for every person to have a job is assumed, which i suppose could be taken to mean a responsibility to make people money. In capitalistic socities there is no garuntee of business success; the fundamental principle being either you should make money on your own merit or go out of business. At most there is a responsibility to create a fair marketplace, but what that means varries a lot.",

The infringer of a copyright does not assume physical control over the copyright nor wholly deprive its owner of its use. Infringement implicates a more complex set of property interests than does run-of-the-mill theft, conversion, or fraud.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dowling_v._United_States_(1985)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dowling_v._United_States_(19...</a>",

Let&#x27;s say that some government where an IA server is hosted is convinced to nationalize the server. They have legal authority - there&#x27;s much legal latitude for acting in the name of national security, and there&#x27;s an obvious case to be made here: if we consider disinformation to be a security threat than a server hosting reliable and trusted internal history is an obvious asset (e.g. [0]).<p>Such an act would easily override any legal attempts by the publishers, and can be pushed for even after a conviction and bankruptcy and without involving the IA foundation at all.<p>The danger is that post-nationalization the information would not be considered reliable - this can be ameliorated if the servers are immediately rerendered to a private party, but it&#x27;s enough of a downside to make this a last option to push for.

You can poll pbpaste&#x2F;xsel in your terminal and generate a log of the clipboard buffer without any privileges.

Now that you get a notification whenever an app reads the clipboard, it has become fairly clear a lot of apps are reading clipboards constantly. For what\u2026 we all wonder.",

I won&#x27;t claim to fully understand how tty programs work. However:<p>* `emacs` documentation describes an ability to interact with the user&#x27;s system clipboard [1].<p>* `tmux` integrates with the user&#x27;s system clipboard [2].<p>* `mosh` apparently caches the user&#x27;s system clipboard [3].<p>* `vim` has special registers to represent the user&#x27;s system clipboard [4] [5].<p>If the system is using dbus (nearly every Linux based OS), it&#x27;s pretty easy to do. Here&#x27;s a python script using GTK to do so [6]. A high level overview of the clipboard is described in the freedesktop specification [7].<p>I think it&#x27;s really unfortunate that desktop and CLI software is so insecure.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;software&#x2F;emacs&#x2F;manual&#x2F;html_node&#x2F;emacs&#x2F;Clipboard.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;software&#x2F;emacs&#x2F;manual&#x2F;html_node&#x2F;emacs&#x2F;Cl...</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;superuser.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;1336764\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;superuser.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;1336764</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;superuser.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;1336764\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;superuser.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;1336764</a><p>[4]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vi.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;96\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vi.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;96</a><p>[5]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vim.fandom.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Accessing_the_system_clipboard\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vim.fandom.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Accessing_the_system_clipboard</a><p>[6]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;21337063&#x2F;1111557\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;21337063&#x2F;1111557</a><p>[7]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;specifications.freedesktop.org&#x2F;clipboards-spec&#x2F;clipboards-latest.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;specifications.freedesktop.org&#x2F;clipboards-spec&#x2F;clipb...</a>",

None of us have anything to hide. Then the government passes a law that all conversations must be streamed on Youtube Live, so an agent comes in, sets up a camera at our table, and starts streaming.<p>We still don&#x27;t &quot;have anything to hide&quot;. We&#x27;re just having a conversation. But the conversation used to be private--that&#x27;s normal. Now it&#x27;s not private, which is not normal.<p>Whether or not you feel like you have to &quot;hide&quot; anything during a bar conversation is not the point. It&#x27;s whether you think we should make changes to our society where having a private conversation is never allowed.<p>This kind of analogy, in my experience, helps people understand that the &quot;nothing to hide&quot; argument assumes that privacy is only for evil people, when in reality it&#x27;s the very normal default of daily life. The parable posted in another top-level comment is also great.",

Their public image in the community was one of great wealth and benevolence; due to some bad financial moves, they&#x27;d lost everything a few years back and their kids, grandkids, and great grandkids had scrambled to buy the house out from them, a loving gesture, so they could maintain their image. I learned of this secret (which itself isn&#x27;t really shameful, people make mistakes, even big ones!) after a year or so.<p>They were both of the &quot;we have nothing to hide,&quot; but one day I asked whether they&#x27;d like their neighbors to know about their penury; they told me to shut up and mind my own business.<p>Nothing to hide? Everyone&#x27;s got something to hide, but for the most part we don&#x27;t know it, because they&#x27;re hiding it!!",

A conversation in a bar is public already; you have no idea if the person sitting across the room might have a microphone trained on you and recording the conversation, because you are speaking in a group within a larger group with no protections. There is no expectation of privacy so there is no argument for privacy in that analogy.<p>It&#x27;s far better to ask <i>why</i> we should have encryption (for our safety, our security, and yes, our personal privacy) rather than <i>whether</i> we should have it. The government, with this bill, is debating whether we should have it, when it&#x27;s obvious to the people that we definitely should. Turn that around on the senators proposing it; ask them if they want to build in back doors into our digital lives, can we as their employers and electors do the same thing to them?",

The only exception to this are highways where, in fact, 70% of the time, there is no general speed limit. Even so, specific sections will always have speed limits (e.g. around a construction site), and additionally, there are strict rules for how to behave on the highway (in particular, it&#x27;s absolutely 100% forbidden to pass a car on the right and you generally have to drive as far to the right as possible unless you want to pass a slower vehicle).",

Whats the rush?<p>It&#x27;s not that simple that less speed equals more safety. Even the posted link shows no correlation.<p>Some people argue that speed in Germany is not risk, but a safety measure. German highways are already mostly overloaded with traffic. Decreasing the speed by introducing the artificial limits would effective make driving more dangerous because highways would be more crowded with drivers with less distance between, there would be more lane changing during driving, drivers will be more tired because of spending more time on the road. Also, driving at the uniform speed at the speed limit reduces awareness of the road conditions.<p>Another topic is that limit also works as a framing. On the road where limit is 120, everyone will tend to drive around 120, regardless of conditions. For the road without speed limit, people will generally drive 100 if that&#x27;s optimal speed according to the current traffic conditions. And if it&#x27;s safe to drive 180, why not?",

                                    "text": "Of course, from a physics perspective, lower speeds means less force in an accident.  To take an extreme example, if we set a nationwide speed limit at 1 mph (1.6 km&#x2F;h in kangaroo units) and enforce it completely, we might not have any traffic fatalities.  What if at a 5 mph speed limit, one person dies in total across the entire country?  Do you say that driving at 1 mph is safe and driving at 5 mph is putting lives at risk?  Well, I guess <i>statistically</i> that is the case, but only if you ignore all of the other factors that went into the crash and attribute everything to speed.<p>For most accidents there is more than one factor that contributed to the accident.  While speed is a measurable and oft-cited factor in a crash, it is not necessarily the reason that the crash occurred.  Example:  Someone drives 75 in a 70 zone, stops paying attention, and drives off the road into a wall.  Speed and inattention could likely both be cited by forensic examiners as a factor, but the crash may have had the same outcome regardless of the speeding and entirely determined by the inattention.<p>And to the other opposite, there are plenty of scenarios where someone could follow the legal speed limit of a road while operating their car at an unsafe speed.  Someone could drive 65 in a 70 zone on an icy road, or past stopped traffic, etc.  While they are following the legal speed limit, they are operating at a speed that puts others at risk.<p>Basically, speed limits are an easy to understand approximation of what is usually a good idea for most drivers in most cars under reasonable conditions.  Given that, sometimes they are too high and sometimes they are too low.<p>You might find this page interesting:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ite.org&#x2F;technical-resources&#x2F;topics&#x2F;speed-management-for-safety&#x2F;setting-speed-limits&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ite.org&#x2F;technical-resources&#x2F;topics&#x2F;speed-managem...</a>",

                "text": "No, because when police have a search warrant and storm your home, they can&#x27;t seize the private conversation you had in bed with your partner a year earlier. They can&#x27;t suck the memories out of your head. Technology like mobile phones and messaging have become an extension of us, they are used for private conversations and personal memories. Breaking encryption on these is not like search warrants of yesteryear, and not like wire taps. In traditional search warrant they would not be seizing communications. And in wire taps they would only get conversations going forward, not years in the past that they can search through, and even with conversations going forward they sometimes wouldn&#x27;t be allowed to listen to personal conversations.<p>The Bill of Rights (first ten amendments to the constitution) is all about protecting us against abuses of government officials. It presumes people in government could be bad, and we need protecting from them. By allowing a government official to seize all our private conversations it could allow a bad government official to go fishing and find things things that they can use against their enemies. There are many, many laws. Many of them aren&#x27;t enforced, but could be.<p>For example in some states adultery is illegal, even a felony in some states. Not just in small states, but in New York, Massachusetts, and Michigan. In Massachusetts there hasn&#x27;t been an adultery conviction since 1983. But if law enforcement was allowed to decrypt an iPhone, and find private bedroom things, it could be used as an attack on a political enemy.<p>It isn&#x27;t only &quot;bad people&quot; that should be worried about the government. I think pretty much everyone agrees Martin Luther King Jr. was a good person. But the government at the time didn&#x27;t think so. When he was killed the first people on the scene were the police officers who were doing surveillance of him from across the street. That is the kind of government we need to be protected from.",

Search warrants definitely aim to seize communications and intrude into private notes, collections, offline-only meetings, affairs, and all kinds of potentially embarrassing bedroom items that were purchased anonymously.<p>The only real defence against government abuse is strengthening democratic institutions, respect for human rights, strong oversight, transparency etc.. End-to-end encryption is quite a shallow&#x2F;weak protection since a truly tyrannical government can easily make it illegal at any time. A lot of government abuse is also possible without breaking encryption.<p>So I think the benefit of end-to-end encryption in protecting against abusive governments is often over-stated. But what about the costs? For example technological progress is making the world more dangerous. Should it be easy for a bunch of people to use unbreakable encryption to coordinate the development extremely dangerous genetically engineered bio-weapons from their homes? If one such person is caught should it be really impossible for 5 judges to allow the police to find all those they&#x27;ve been talking to?",

However there is no law preventing a tech company that provides &quot;encrypted messaging&quot; from decrypting people&#x27;s communications.  There is not even a contract with users.  If they do this, their liability is zero.

There simply are bad people in the world, and I wish it were different, but it&#x27;s not. &#x27;Just trust us&#x27; are words often told to us by people who only want power - at our expense.<p>The best sentiment I&#x27;ve ever heard about privacy is from Shoshana Zuboff, and it&#x27;s now influenced my thoughts. It&#x27;s at the end of her amazing 2018 book &#x27;Surveillance Capitalism&#x27;, the best book on tech I have ever read. She shares a conclusion along this line: To be private and free from surveillance is to be <i>human</i>. If we have no privacy, we lose our humanity.<p>She explains that there is a direct connection between being watched, and being controlled. We need freedom of diversity - to will - to decide for ourselves. Otherwise, and now I conclude, bad actors with power lust will only bend the world to their vision.<p>The guilt-tripping words of &quot;nothing to hide&quot; come from a place of privilege - or worse, hypocrisy. It is an insult to anyone who is different from the norm, and who wants to be themselves. What you have every right to hide does not even have to be illegal, but often it is, like LGBTQ people last century. Illegal \u2260 immoral.<p>Privacy is a core freedom to protect human diversity. It must not be shamed. It must be <i>loved</i>. Cherished. Treasured.<p>Privacy begets diversity. Surveillance begets conformity. Which one is more important for the development of life in the universe?<p>As a child, I instinctively knew that privacy was something natural and important in life. Now as an adult, with education and intellect I can articulate why - and resist psychological manipulation and intellectual dishonesty from others trying to tell us that privacy should die.<p>I&#x27;m able to see the insanity of my own age.

Then the government passes a law that all conversations must be streamed on Youtube Live, so an agent comes in, sets up a camera at our table, and starts streaming.<p>If we are doing imaginary situations, the proponents of this bill can also do something like this:<p>Imagine there is a bar, where the police are unable to go inside. Every day, people go into the bar to plan terror attacks or to spread hate and racism. They can have whoever from across the world join them in the private bar without the police being able to find out. Sometimes they also bring young children into the bar to sexually exploit them. Other times, they bring vulnerable young men and indoctrinate them with their racist hate. The owner of the bar knows that those kinds of things are happening, but they say, a lot of people just come into the bar to talk with friends, so we never allow the police to come. In addition, before serving drinks, the owner puts on a blindfold and stuffs their ears with cotton so they won&#x27;t be able to see or hear what is going on. They live by the principle: See no evil, hear no evil. The owner of the bar is making a lot of money from the people using the bar.<p>Don&#x27;t you think we should keep the terrorists, and neo-Nazis, and child molesters from having a bar that they can go to to do and plan their evil stuff that police cannot get to? Don&#x27;t you think that the bar owners, instead of stuffing their ears and covering their eyes so they are unable to see the bad stuff, should make sure that bad people aren&#x27;t using their bar for evil stuff. Sure, just like in the real world, you will have your privacy just like you have in your home or at the local bar. But, you would want a real life bar owner to not close their eyes to people using their bar as a planning ground for terrorism, or who are bringing young kids with fake id&#x27;s to the bar to exploit them, or who are filling young men&#x27;s minds with hateful, racist lies? Also, just like the police can get a search warrant for a bad person&#x27;s home or a bar where a lot of bad people are congregating and planning and doing bad things, we think they should also be allowed to do that in the online world.<p>Now tell me, to the average non-tech voter, which will pull the most emotional strings?",

Would you want a real life bar owner to record you on the toilet just so that one day the police can track some bad guys easily? Probably not. Do you think it&#x27;s reasonable to expect privacy on the toilet even when you&#x27;re in a bar owned by someone else? Yes, even if it might one day make law enforcement a little harder.

Not really. But do I want that same data that Google has to be in the hands of someone like Putin? No. I don&#x27;t even want it in the hands of the NSA. The issue is that if we say that ads can manipulate people to buy things, why can&#x27;t they manipulate people to do things like vote or divide. Russia&#x27;s strategy since the Cold War has been to divide and prod The West, to sow disruption. That disruption has caused consolidation of power but also makes it difficult for coalitions to get things done.<p>It is clear that anger generates more clicks, so why is it unrealistic to think bad actors can use that data to better divide us and sow discontent?<p>The next factor is that democracy relies on a distribution of power. Data collection is a means to consolidate power. There&#x27;s the term &quot;turnkey tyranny&quot; that&#x27;s thrown around. The reason isn&#x27;t because we think a tyrant is going to come to power and destroy our way of life, but rather that we recognize that such a thing is possible and want to ensure that such actions would be infeasible if a malicious actor gained power. In democracy power is distributed. This has pros and cons. But the point of distribution is so that consolidation is difficult and we can never have a monarch or tyrant.<p>So it has never been about having something to hide (which btw, do people know they are referencing Goebbels?), but about stability in democracy. Distribution of power that was inherent to the system in the past is no longer built in. Technology has changed and enabled things we never previously imagined.",

Discussing things like why privacy matters and not just to bad guys or with the silly &quot;you wear clothes&quot; analogies. It is also a great time to talk about structural reforms like switching to better voting methods, such as STAR (see my comments for rants on why you should not use IRV&#x2F;&quot;RCV&quot;). At this time people have the time to think and research, but there is also the drawback that it is hard to think when you are worried about food and future.  But this time to also talk about solving problems while they are small. If the Great Depression taught us anything it is that those people learned a lot about frugality but their children forgot. Luckily it appears that each time we do this we get slightly better (think like a damped harmonic oscillator). So don&#x27;t give up hope, help the dampening coefficient.",

This gives a chance to try to hack a single storage location to have a trojan horse version spread through their network. Finally, it affects recruiting. Basically only someone already comitted will go to the trouble of having Mujahadeen Secrets on their device, whereas a lot more people could be expected to have a common end-to-end messenger on their device.

The problem remains that if anything resembling the &quot;EARN IT&quot; bill passes, then attacks against encryption will _scale too effectively_, and the USA will have exposed itself to having the secrets of thousands of politicians and civil servants leaked to an adversary at once.

But it seems that whenever computers are involved, lawmakers become _so_ incredibly short-sighted that it verges on madness.<p>Consider this: a bill requiring a small GPS and remote-controlled bomb to be installed in the engine of every car would allow the police to entirely avoid dangerous high-speed pursuits.

It shows that people love to click on videos that read &quot;stepdad and stepdaughter ...&quot; and similar taglines. America has a problem with the whole &quot;call me daddy&quot; fetish. I never understood what this is about. It&#x27;s deeply pedophelic imho and it&#x27;s the main reason why I hate porn. It looks like it&#x27;s hard to find videos where some form of domination (rough sex) isn&#x27;t part of it. the way women are treated is IMO the gateway which normalizes violence first against women (even pretend rape is a genre here pushed by pornhub &amp; co). why do people get off on this and why do porn companies get away with it ?? &lt;- my opinion is to start the crackdown on this type of messaging here and before even cracking down have a discussion about wtf is wrong with people? why do they have to strangle each other during sex?<p>&gt; Facebook has been around for 15 years now without E2E encryption. I have not noticed lives being destroyed but perhaps you can share examples?<p>the problem with FB is mostly that it many countries FB _is_ the Internet. Myanmar (the Rohinga&#x27;s) would be a fitting example. Also the Philipines where the Duarte government is currently using it on their brutal war on drugs. If there would be justice Zuck and anyone working at FB would be rotting in jail even before we discuss pedophelia. thousands in the Philipines have been killed thanks to Duarte&#x27;s messaging. FB literally kills and gets away with it.<p>FB agreeing to develop 0days to crack down on a few cases doesn&#x27;t make them the good guys. I believe the world would be better off if FB wouldn&#x27;t exist at all.<p>Vice is also known to push a pro-cop pro-LE agenda. I stopped watching their videos and reading their content when they showed how cannabis production in Albania hurts Europe (wtf) ... they are a pro-cop &amp; ultra-conservative outlet. Screw vice and screw cops.<p>&gt; I can&#x27;t cite any numbers, but it seems the majority of convictions I&#x27;ve read have some variation of evidence being found on phones,<p>I know security companies love to cite their work with law-enforcement and how they help fight crime. when I had an interview with the biggest Swiss security company few years ago they bragged about their work with Interpol and how they help fight the bad guys. But nobody ever mentions that the software companies like NSO, Gamma, HackingTeam makes doesn&#x27;t just allow LS to compromise phones (people assume it&#x27;s read-only) when reality is the features are always read-write. Putting things on these devices is possible because from an engineering pov why would you limit a feature and not allow write access ... I know enough cops who brag about how they abuse their power . So why would I trust them not to plant shit on these phones (especially when they&#x27;re convinced that they&#x27;re dealing with a bad guy).",

Our representative government represent corporations and the deep state, in the original Peter Dale Scott sense of the term (as opposed to the more recent abuse of it), and not the people.<p>They have continually made moves like this, in a boiling frog fashion. Until we the people wake up from the two party divide and conquer system, very little will change, excepting very rare circumstances of pressure exerted en masse (SOPA&#x2F;PIPA is a good example outlier).<p>I&#x27;ve thought about solutions to this problem for a long time, and my conclusion is the things needed are the following (in order to prevent a long term overton window shift as has been happening):<p>1. Renewed participation in local politics and elections, especially at the state level, but also county, city, etc.<p>2. Once that is achieved, voting in ranked choice voting initiatives. This will enable the next step.<p>3. Stop voting for anyone based on party, in particular the main power structure is based on the majority rule in the house and senate... the end goal would be to take away the majority from both parties. This is a huge undertaking, so I&#x27;m not saying it would be easy, or even possible, but I think it is what is required. I think those paying attention enough and not enured to the tribalism of the parties understands they cannot be reformed from the inside. They are simply too entrenched, and have too many mechanisms to get rid of those who seek to do so. The point is that we don&#x27;t need to gain a majority with this new coalition party of independents and third parties, we simply need to take the majority away from the two main parties. To get this done though, [1] must be done, because many of the state laws have been manipulated by the duopoly to prevent third parties and independents.<p>3.1 To avoid fracturing of the coalition, there should be some very rudimentary and base document that all persons running can agree on. This is also difficult but, since all congresspeople swear an oath to the constitution (5 U.S. Code \u00a7 3331), something that reaffirms the principles of the constitution would be the best start. If they violate this, the coalition should work to remove them immediately. (something similar to Gingrich&#x27;s &quot;Contract with America&quot;)<p>4. Currently, and many don&#x27;t know this, congresspeople have to sign an affidavit (5 U.S. Code \u00a7 3333) confirming their oath. I think we should then work towards enforcement of the laws against violation thereof, the primary one being perjury, or something similar (18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1918, 5 U.S. Code \u00a7 7311). For example, how many people have straight up lied to congress and had no action taken against them? (Clapper is one of the more egregious ones that comes to mind, but the point is congress is in dereliction of duty in enforcing perjury laws)<p>This would give the people a real opportunity to start passing laws that represent the people (such as term limits), but are still constitutionally sound.<p>The legislative is the branch closest to the people, and this is why it should be the focus. From a cleaned up legislative we can begin to resurrect the separation of power between the branches that has been egregiously eroded, primarily by the executive. The current checks and balances system is crumbling. A huge part of this erosion is the surveillance system, which enables compromise of congresspeople by the executive and the MICC. We must fight for privacy, both encryption and anonymity, as a fundamental part of protecting the checks and balances system.",

The other major branch of voting systems is cardinal voting, where candidates are independently rated, rather than ranked.[1]<p>&gt; The similar term &quot;Ranked Choice Voting&quot; (RCV) is used by the US organization FairVote to refer to the use of ranked ballots with specific counting methods: either instant-runoff voting for single-winner elections or single transferable vote for multi-winner elections. In some locations, the term &quot;preferential voting&quot; is used to refer to this combination of ballot type and counting method, while in other locations this term has various more-specialized meanings.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ranked_voting\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ranked_voting</a><p>I share your frustration with FairVote and CGP Grey (and recently an episode of Patriot Act) painting an unrealistically rosy picture of RCV&#x2F;IRV as the solution to our voting problems.<p>There are some other systems that aren&#x27;t ranked voting at all that I think would be significantly better than IRV, such as approval voting, range voting, and STAR voting (which is basically range voting with an immediate runoff between the top two).<p>For some reason, FairVote persists in claiming that in approval voting (which is like traditional first-past-the-post voting except that you can vote for more than one candidate), you somehow maximize your voting influence by voting for only one candidate.  They call this bullet voting.  I don&#x27;t know what possible reason one could have for believing this.<p>This manifests in their comparison chart:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fairvote.org&#x2F;alternatives\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fairvote.org&#x2F;alternatives</a><p>They show &quot;resistance to strategic voting&quot; as &quot;high&quot; under RCV and &quot;low&quot; under approval voting.  This is somewhat subjective, but I think they&#x27;ve got it backwards.  Under approval voting, strategic voting and honest voting are basically the same: you vote for as many of the candidates as you can tolerate, and maybe if there&#x27;s a candidate you really don&#x27;t want to win you vote for everyone but them.  Under RCV, it&#x27;s only safe to put you first choice first if they are either clearly in the lead or so far behind they have no hope of winning.  If the outcome is in doubt, it&#x27;s possible to cause your first place candidate to lose by putting them first.  (That&#x27;s a weird problem for any voting system to have.)<p>For this reason, I don&#x27;t trust FairVote; I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re presenting their preferred voting system or the alternatives honestly.  They&#x27;re more of an advocacy&#x2F;PR organization that&#x27;s pushing their chosen solution out of a sense of inertia or something.<p>The Center for Election Science is a smaller, less-well funded group that advocates for approval voting (and similar methods) that I donate to from time to time.

Score voting is &quot;like&quot; approval voting but with more precision (really approval is just the binary version of score). STAR05 is often suggested because experimentation shows that it has enough expressiveness to generate good winners but is simple. You can always add more expressiveness by increasing the range in which you can score candidates, but there&#x27;s diminishing returns as you increase it and added complexity (I don&#x27;t think people will have a problem rating 0-10 though since we actually do that a lot).<p>I cannot think of any way that IRV beats out STAR. In STAR&#x27;s worst case scenario (1-sided strategy) it still has a VSE equal to IRV&#x27;s best scenario (100% honest). Any more honesty that people have in STAR just improves peoples&#x27; satisfaction. This is actually one of the main arguments of cardinal systems over ordinal systems (e.g. STAR vs RP&#x2F;IRV).<p>If you&#x27;re really into the ordinal camp, I&#x27;d also strongly encourage you to look into Ranked Pairs. The satisfaction is A LOT higher than IRV does. On the ballot side it is no different than what the voter sees in IRV (really this is fairly consistent for ordinal systems, by definition).<p>But I want to stress that STAR and Approval are not equivalent. I also want to stress that scoring is an extremely familiar concept to most people. &quot;Rate this drive out of 5 stars.&quot; &quot;On a scale of 1 to 10 how would you rate...&quot; etc. So I&#x27;d argue that STAR is fairly expressive (which seems to be your major complaint) and is a simple and easy concept for voters to understand (since they are already familiar with it).",

I explain it as, STAR voting is score voting on a 0-5 scale followed by an automatic (&quot;instant&quot;) top two runoff. Whereas approval voting is score voting on a 0-1 binary scale. STAR voting performs a tiny bit better in computer simulations of voter satisfaction, but approval voting has the practical benefit of being super simple and requiring no voting machine upgrades. Both are superior to IRV.<p>Here&#x27;s the first email I received from Mark Frohnmayer where he discussed STAR voting, following my speaking at his conference at University of Oregon, that gave birth to it. :)\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ClayShentrup&#x2F;status&#x2F;1278118075972202496\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ClayShentrup&#x2F;status&#x2F;1278118075972202496</a>",

RCV makes people think that this is the only way you can rank people.<p>&gt; STAR<p>Anyone who is advocating for STAR has my approval. It is the preferred system in my mind.

Pushing the your argument past the point of validity in an effort to make it stronger. Their use of broad classes is a gross mischaracterization. When they discuss Condorcet methods they discuss several types, lumping together the worst features from different ones. But they ignore the good methods like RP and Schulze. The comparisons are unfair. But then again, they aren&#x27;t trying to appeal to people that are informed on the subject, they are trying to appeal to the masses which are completely unfamiliar with the subjects. But I do not think this justifies the outright lying and mischaracterizations.<p>&gt; Spoilers and Strategy<p>In my other post I actually link an example of where IRV fails, and it is the specific type of spoiling that we are about: when similar candidates spoil (e.g. Bernie and Biden, not Stein and Biden). IRV doesn&#x27;t solve this (but FV claims otherwise).<p>For strategy, this is the argument that I get into with the Condorcet camp (though we&#x27;re clearly on the same side and these are nuanced friendly arguments not hostile). To me STAR is good because its range of VSE is more compact (i.e. resistant to strategies). The Condorcet camp claims that there is enough dis-incentivization to not vote strategically therefore just maximize VSE (VSE is only slightly different between STAR05 and RP). So for anyone listening on the sidelines, this is really what we&#x27;re arguing, minutia. I&#x27;m certain everyone in the Condorcet camp would vote for STAR and everyone in the STAR&#x2F;Score&#x2F;Approval camp would vote for Condorcet (specifically RP) if given the chance.<p>&gt; Center For Election Science<p>I&#x27;d also like to mention Equal Vote, which advocates for STAR. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.equal.vote&#x2F;starvoting\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.equal.vote&#x2F;starvoting</a>",

Because once IRV is the status quo it will be hard to continue moving forward. After all, we already have the capabilities.

The interview I linked to with Dr. Arrow I think expands on this well. If asked to advocate for a system, advocate for score (STAR). But that isn&#x27;t to recognize that there&#x27;s so much uncertainty in Social Choice Theory that we can trust theory alone. There&#x27;s smaller experiments that have been done, but nothing on the scale we are advocating for. Of course we expect the theory and experiments to be relatively accurate, but we must acknowledge the lack of empirical large scale data. Frankly, you can only get that by doing it.<p>&gt; Of course, if we were using STAR&#x2F;Score&#x2F;Approval to vote on which voting system to use then I could express my preferences more accurately.<p>;) For me<p>STAR 5, Score: 4 (4.5), Approval: 4, RP: 3 (3.8), Schulze: 3, IRV: 1 Plurality: 0",

Essentially, you again have to choose how much you care about voting for your favorite option vs voting against your least favorite option.

                        "text": "I want to push back against this, and specifically fair vote.<p>- What they are referring to as RCV is called Instant Runoff Voting (IRV). IRV is a RCV, but RCV isn&#x27;t IRV. Think &quot;Rock and Roll is The Beatles&quot; vs &quot;The Beatles are a Rock and Roll group.&quot;<p>- IRV isn&#x27;t that great when it comes to Voter Satisfaction Efficiency (VSE)[0]. There&#x27;s even other RCV methods like Ranked Pair[1] that are exactly the same for the voter. Essentially IRV is a 6% improvement upon plurality (what we currently use) but RP is a 15% increase from plurality. So I ask, why go to IRV when we can do twice as good? (or better! Keep reading)<p>- Fair Vote claims that IRV has a high resistance to spoiler candidates (a candidate that takes away votes from another similar candidate). This is actually why the distinction from RCV and IRV is important and why Fair Vote is misleading. While RCV is better than plurality in this respect, some RCVs are better than others. IRV doesn&#x27;t adequately solve this issue (but there are other RCVs that do!). IRV fails when two candidates are similar in positions and similar in popularity. [2] This is specifically the kind of spoiling that we are trying to prevent. We&#x27;re trying to prevent a candidate like Sanders from spoiling Biden (or vise versa) not Jill Stein spoiling Biden. IRV prevents the latter, but not the former. I am specifically upset with Fair Vote because they are misleading in this context. Because they claim IRV := RCV, they take all the things different RCV methods solve and claim IRV solves them. This is simply not true (and why I make the first bullet).<p>- There are just better methods besides ranking (also called &quot;ordinal&quot; methods). There&#x27;s a class called Cardinal[3], that is actually simpler. The simplest is called approval. An example of approval is Netflix&#x27;s rating system (binary). It does pretty well. Better yet is range&#x2F;score voting. This would be the old Netflix system where you rated out of 5 stars. The difference in ranked vs cardinal is that you rate each candidate or policy independent of the others. This allows you to be more precise&#x2F;honest (you may actually like two candidates equally!). It also reduces complexity because a common accident in ranking is rating two candidates the same. In ordinal systems this is a bug, in cardinal this is a feature.<p>- I want to specifically mention STAR voting[4]. While STAR isn&#x27;t perfect, it much better handles various types of spoiler candidates, has a high VSE (similar to that of RP), and handles strategic voting well. The last is the major reason you should choose STAR over RP (and there&#x27;s no reason you should choose IRV over RP, because RP is strictly better). While all three systems encourage honest voting (in a single agent scenario) strategic voting is always an issue. Under no circumstance is STAR worse than IRV because STAR handles strategic voting. Specifically the most important kind is the &quot;1-sided strategy&quot;[5] which is arguably very common.<p>- Lastly, I want to appeal to authority. Kennith Arrow (who you may be familiar with from Arrow&#x27;s Impossibility theorem and Gibbard&#x27;s extension) is a Nobel Laureate and said cardinal systems are &quot;probably right.&quot;[6] And I think many of us know science speak into the confidence that conveys. That link is a full interview with him from Election Science. It is a good read&#x2F;listen.<p>TLDR: We want a good voting system, use STAR, not IRV.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electionscience.github.io&#x2F;vse-sim&#x2F;vse.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electionscience.github.io&#x2F;vse-sim&#x2F;vse.html</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ranked_pairs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ranked_pairs</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.electionscience.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;the-spoiler-effect&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.electionscience.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;the-spoiler-effect&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cardinal_voting\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cardinal_voting</a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;STAR_voting\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;STAR_voting</a><p>[5] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electionscience.github.io&#x2F;vse-sim&#x2F;VSE&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electionscience.github.io&#x2F;vse-sim&#x2F;VSE&#x2F;</a><p>[6] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.electionscience.org&#x2F;commentary-analysis&#x2F;voting-theory-podcast-2012-10-06-interview-with-nobel-laureate-dr-kenneth-arrow&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.electionscience.org&#x2F;commentary-analysis&#x2F;voting-t...</a>",

I hadn&#x27;t heard of STAR in particular.<p>Two counterpoints:<p>- I&#x27;m aware of Arrow, but I file it under &quot;perfect being the enemy of the good&quot;. :) Whatever the flaws of IRV, it still represents an order of magnitude improvement over FPTP at capturing political preferences. (We suffer so much status quo bias, it takes a lot of activation energy just to communicate to the average voter that better options exist at all!) But I happily cede the point: IRV is not the best choice of all the available options.<p>- My favorite is actually Approval, and I don&#x27;t always bring it up because it has lower mindshare and is less self-descriptive &#x2F; &quot;sticky-branding&quot; compared to Ranked Choice. My reasons for the preference:<p>(a) There&#x27;s no nitpicking over counting methods: whoever gets the most votes wins.<p>(b) Easy to explain to voters (including the counting system), and degrades gracefully for those who still want to vote for only one candidate. (I&#x27;ve heard objections that some voters hit a cheater-detection trigger, that &quot;some people get more votes than others&quot;; this can be solved by reframing as &quot;Y&#x2F;N&quot; per candidate, so X candidates = X Y&#x2F;N votes per voter).<p>(c) I believe it largely sidesteps Arrow by redefining the success condition: rather than attempt to perfectly measure ideal preferences, it definitionally represents &quot;Consent of the Governed&quot;: not who&#x27;s your favorite, but who are you willing to live with? This would make it more difficult for bolder and more unconventional candidates, but at the benefit of rewarding coalitions and consensus-building. Polarization and sowing distrust would cease to be a viable strategy.<p>(As an aside, in a perfect world, a blank ballot would be counted as a meta-vote for &quot;None of the Above&quot;; and if it wins, a whole new election of all-new candidates must be held.)",

But what I&#x27;m trying to say is that we already have substantially better methods, so why not use them? Perfect is the enemy of good, but if I have the choice of eating acid, a bowl of oatmeal, and chocolate pudding, I&#x27;m going with the pudding. Perfect is the enemy of good when we don&#x27;t already have the choices sitting right in front of us.<p>&gt; [IRV] still represents an order of magnitude improvement over FPTP at capturing political preferences<p>And here&#x27;s where I&#x27;m disagreeing, but only slightly. It is definitely better, but not an order of magnitude.<p>&gt; Approval voting<p>I love approval voting. It is great because of its simplicity. That&#x27;s why they use it in systems like Netflix. Easy to collect and gather results from. Honestly I use it all the time. It is how I solve the &quot;where do you want to eat&quot; problem with friends. You just list things until you get a unanimous vote or if you exhaust your list you just take the most approvals. Simple and easy.<p>The reason I don&#x27;t like it for elections is that it makes tying easy and I do not believe it has enough precision. The interview I linked Arrow talks about this so I&#x27;ll deffer to him (he&#x27;s clearly smarter than me). In elections you need a clear winner.<p>Why I like score voting (and Condorcet methods, like RP, which is again RCV) is because I actually hate party systems, but I recognize that they can&#x27;t be destroyed. But these methods drastically reduce their power (I don&#x27;t think IRV does).<p>And I highly encourage you to dig more into the subject and am happy to provide links. I also highly suggest looking deep into everything that the Fair Vote chart discusses, mainly because I believe you will be as frustrated as me (and others, like Condorcet proponents) when you learn what each of those topics are. Everyone I know that is well read in the subject is frustrated by Fair Vote&#x27;s mischaracterizations.",

I also don&#x27;t see it as a problem to specifically non-ordinal, but to <i>every</i> system. I like to try to explain a STAR05 ballot simply to people with a forum they are very familiar with. A ballot might look like below<p>How do you feel about ___x___ candidate?<p>Very Unfavorably, unfavorably, neutral, favorably, very favorably<p>Those are your 5 options. Yes, this isn&#x27;t exact, but we can&#x27;t have an infinite score. But as we understand distributions, we know that the fluctuations won&#x27;t matter much. If a group of people have an &quot;honest&quot; opinion that a candidate is rated &quot;favorably&quot; (or a 4) we&#x27;ll see a distribution around this (a fairly tight distribution). So you&#x27;ll get some 3&#x27;s and 5&#x27;s, but most people will give 4&#x27;s and the average will be 4. So it isn&#x27;t an issue. Similarly, if you are ranking people and view two candidates equally 50% of people will put candidate A in front of B and vise versa (well real world there&#x27;d be a bias for things like: who is listed first, &quot;nicer&quot; sounding name, familiarity, etc. But still, that&#x27;s not too big of an issue because at the end we get pretty close to the optimal efficiency that the system can provide). You have to remember that there is no perfect system, Arrow and Gibbard showed that. But the question is if we statistically come close to the optimal (that the system can provide).<p>I want to point out that simple approval voting is <i>VERY</i> effective, even though it is low precision. You&#x27;re literally choosing &quot;like&quot; and &quot;dislike.&quot; Analysts aren&#x27;t that concerned with the lack of objectivity in the difference between a 4 and 5 or a 3 and 4 because it is much more refined. If this is a major concern, then extend the expressiveness by increasing the range, e.g. 0-10.<p>I would also encourage you to listen to that interview that I linked. Arrow briefly discusses this topic. He makes some criticisms of score voting but also says it is the option he would push (question is which he&#x27;d advocate for). Remember, there is no such thing as a perfect voting system. There&#x27;s always a trade-off. We&#x27;re just trying to minimize the trade-offs.<p>And personally, if someone made RP popular I would gladly advocate for it. But because we&#x27;re trying to trade one shitty system (plurality) for something only slightly less shitty (IRV) I am going to be vocal about the issues and lying that is happening. I don&#x27;t really have an issue with RCVs, but specifically IRV. This is why I wanted to make a clear distinction between the two. Because when the discussions come up we end up using different languages, using the same words to describe different things. This may have been a smart move by Fair Vote, but we&#x27;re on Hacker News and there&#x27;s an expectation of more nuance than we&#x27;d have in other places like Reddit or in person.",

A great example of why tech companies don&#x27;t need immunity. Broadcast TV ads are sold on a smaller scale, such that humans are involved in the process and bad actors are caught early.<p>&gt; Citation needed.<p>The general problem here is that Google is the only one with meaningful data, and obviously they&#x27;re very motivated not to reveal how big a market illegal activity is on their platform. Note that even in legitimate verticals, scams push the bidding higher for advertising on their platforms. So not only does Google make money directly off scammers, they also make more money off legitimate advertisers because the bidding was higher. Google both claims that there&#x27;s no data proving their business is illegitimate, while keeping all the data secret. So we <i>have</i> to rely on the evidence we can see.<p>A great example is what The Verge uncovered in 2017 with rehab scams: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;9&#x2F;7&#x2F;16257412&#x2F;rehabs-near-me-google-search-scam-florida-treatment-centers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;9&#x2F;7&#x2F;16257412&#x2F;rehabs-near-me-go...</a> where they found some insane CPCs: &quot;If you\u2019re in Arizona, and you click on the top ad, you\u2019ll cost that advertiser around $221&quot;, and Google was actively soliciting business in this extremely valuable market: &quot;The search giant actively courts treatment centers, both online and off. In May, a Google \u201cdigital ambassador\u201d was a featured speaker at the Treatment Center Executive &amp; Marketing Retreat&quot;. They had multiple people directly focused on cultivating business in this particular market. Scammers were both harming consumers directly, and also pushing the CPCs up to insane levels for real drug rehab centers, hurting consumers indirectly as well.<p>You can also see an interesting way Google helps bad actors stay hidden here: &quot;The 800 number was ephemeral. ...Google offers advertisers unique \u201ctracking\u201d phone numbers that forward to a company\u2019s phones, so they can understand which ads are bringing in the most clients. The phone numbers only stay up as long as the ad does.&quot; So you can&#x27;t even meaningfully trace out a phone number on a scam ad back to the company that pays for it. Everything is laundered through Google accounts.<p>After this piece, of course, Google finally acted and more or less shut down their entire drug rehab vertical for a while, and retooled it. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s drastically less profitable now. But the problem is, they got to keep the millions and millions of dollars profit they got from engaging in a business practice that was directly harmful to people.<p>My long time example, which Google still refuses to address, is searches for &quot;mapquest&quot;. MapQuest is a top search term for seniors, who don&#x27;t realize that other directions sites exist. To it&#x27;s credit, MapQuest is still pretty decent. Problem is, Google sells ads for &quot;Maps Quest&quot; that look like the real site, but redirect you to sites that require you install browser-hijacking add-ons in order to proceed (add-ons hosted in the Chrome Web Store, I might add). No matter how many times I&#x27;ve attempted to report them, these sites are allowed to continue doing this. A Googler actually had them removed once, and Google re-enabled the same sites&#x27; ads within a couple of hours.<p>Another fun part of this, is that if MapQuest wants to be presented above those malicious ads, MapQuest has to outbid them... for it&#x27;s own trademarked brand name! Ad squatting is another way Google rakes in massive revenues via essentially blackmail: Pay us or we&#x27;ll let scammers place higher than you for your own name.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t hazard a statistic, because it&#x27;d be a guess, but I imagine if Google were forced to disclose advertisers and spends, you&#x27;d find a substantial portion of Google&#x27;s profits were ill-gotten gains.",

Someone might say &quot;I&#x27;m not conservative, I&#x27;m liberal&quot;. But that is nonsensical. Liberal and conservative are on different spectrums. It would be like saying &quot;I don&#x27;t like white things, I like sweet things&quot;. The color&#x2F;light spectrum is different from the taste spectrum, and vanilla ice cream is both white and sweet. Someone can be liberal and conservative.<p>The three political spectrums are:<p>- Progressive &lt;-&gt; Conservative<p>- Liberal &lt;-&gt; Fascist (Authoritarian)<p>- Left-wing &lt;-&gt; Right-wing<p>Progressive is someone who pushes are for change, major change, and rapid change. Conservative is someone who likes things how they are, wants to make changes slowly and carefully. People can be progressive on some topics (like pushing for civil rights), and conservative on others (like being careful about changing fiscal policy). But lots of people will default to one or the other.<p>Liberal is to allow, a true liberal would allow things they disagree with. A fascist (authoritarian) forces everyone to be like them, and passes laws to force everyone to do as they believe.<p>Left-wing and right-wing is less a spectrum and more clustering of ideologies.<p>Left-wing ideologies generally favor the community as a whole over the individual, and support those with less power or who are less well off. That results in things like pro environment, minority rights, and social welfare. Internationally left-wing could include going to war overseas to protect people from oppression and powerful aggressors.<p>Right-wing ideologies tend to favor the individual and those in power, more everyone for themselves. This could mean freedom to make individual choices that hurt the environment, pro big business, lack of social services. In the extreme it can be racism against minorities. Internationally it could result in isolationist policies.<p>I think if people actually understand the terms, and they are well defined, people can thinks about how they as an individual feel. And maybe that can help us break away from the two-party fighting we have now.<p>I think if people actually analyze there beliefs, they may come to better understand themselves, and people can better understand each other. For example I think some people that call themselves &quot;Progressive Liberals&quot; will find out they they are &quot;Progressive Left-wing Fascist&quot;, and some people who call themselves &quot;Conservative&quot; will find that they are &quot;Conservative Left-wing Liberals&quot;.",

I apologize for using this word that you are reacting strongly to, but I&#x27;ve yet to hear a different straightforward technical term that refers to ever-growing government involvement.",

In it he remarked on both the risks, and industry attitudes:<p><i>There are many amongst us who would not hesitate to build equipment to compromise the privacy of any given individual provided the price is right. These are the whores of industry. They would not hesitate building systems and devices contrary to the public interest; their only concern is the buck.</i><p>The full paper, and in fact, all of Baran&#x27;s RAND publications, are online in full-text, following my request to RAND. I remain grateful to them for this.<p>Baran was also interviewed for a 1966 BBC documentary:<p><i>&quot;Well, he who has access to information controls the game. This is very dangerous. I think both your country and mine have never trusted the government completely. We do so for good reason. Here we have a mechanism that could be abused. Here we have a mechanism that would allow the creation of a dictator. . .</i><p><i>I&#x27;ve yet to see an expression by anyone in Congress about this new type of danger. In fact, we see proposals for centralizing information, we see proposals for rushing ahead into new, more efficient computer information systems, and very little thought is being given to the dangers of the misuse of these systems. . . I ask a lot of people about privacy, why they valued it, and I was surprised by the number of people who said &quot;Well, I don&#x27;t do anything wrong. Why should I worry about privacy?&quot; And then, on the other hand, I think there&#x27;s a more wise group that says, &#x27;Privacy is really the right to be wrong, then go on and live the rest of your life, without having it mark you forever.&#x27; I tend to think this latter view is the view we should hold.</i><p>The video is, unfortunately, no longer online, though it was previously at:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=FwaDvJYZTVk&amp;t=29m31s\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=FwaDvJYZTVk&amp;t=29m31s</a><p>Internet Archive reveals that the programme was &quot;BBC Panorama - California 2000&quot; (1966) (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20180526090012&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=FwaDvJYZTVk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20180526090012&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtu...</a>).

Files of this kind would be highly valueable for many kinds of economic and social research, but they are bought at too high a price if they endanger human freedom or seriously enhance the opportunities of blackmailers. While such dangers should not be ignored, it should be noted that the lack of comprehensive data files has never been the limiting barrier to the suppression of human freedom. The Watergate criminals made extensive, if unskillful, use of electronics, but no computer played a role in their conspiracy. The Nazis operated with horrifying effectiveness and thoroughness without the benefits of any kind of mechanized data processing.&quot;</i><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pdfs.semanticscholar.org&#x2F;a9e7&#x2F;33e25ee8f67d5e670b3b7dc4b8c3e00849ae.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pdfs.semanticscholar.org&#x2F;a9e7&#x2F;33e25ee8f67d5e670b3b7d...</a><p>There is, of course, one slight problem with Simon&#x27;s argument: The Nazis did make heavy use of mechanised data processing, provided and supported by IBM.

As other staff have referenced, our services are encrypted and throw away PII like IP addresses by design. However, I take the point that it is nevertheless safer to do it locally and so we will do that.",

For the same reason people are upset about the favicon thing I don&#x27;t want anything (mis)typed in the urlbar to be sent to a search engine.  I&#x27;ve failed to find the correct setting to make this happen a few times before but just looked again and setting keyword.enabled to false prevents it from searching from the url bar (the setting is confusing and not related to the search keywords feature).<p>I did try firefox search keyword anyway once a while ago but it isn&#x27;t that easy to configure and the setting were lost not too long after I started using it (I don&#x27;t remember the details but I think my profile was corrupted by ecryptfs and the keywords didn&#x27;t import to a new profile or something like that).  Not importing them isn&#x27;t a horrible choice (if that is what actually happened) considering there doesn&#x27;t seem to be an easy way to even list them, but there should at least be a distinct import&#x2F;export for keywords.  The search page of preferences has a keyword field next to search engines but it doesn&#x27;t seem to actually list them nor can you add a keyword from that page.  All in all, it doesn&#x27;t seem like a feature Mozilla cares about at all, although it would be a nice feature with a bit more work.  Use from right click search on text selection would be another thing that would make it much more useful.<p>I tend to use ! in two circumstances, one as others mentioned when a DDG search didn&#x27;t return what I wanted (and I am fine with letting DDG know that since it is the exact same search I just searched DDG) and secondly when I am looking for something on a particular site.  Some of the second case would be best done via Firefox keyword search but the advantage of DDG is that they have a lot of obvious names going to the obvious place so rare specific searches are much more convenient than doing anything to set up a list.  Since I very rarely use such searches, there isn&#x27;t anything DDG could learn about me from avoiding just those searches going to DDG.  OTOH, using site searches more frequently would be a win for privacy.",

For a browser, yes, a client-side solution is possible and probably preferable. Please check and upvote other comment trees.</i><p>This makes sense to me and is not alarming. Getting favicons actually is difficult to do robustly; many applications and websites use Google&#x27;s service to do so, which then leaks the request to Google: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;s2&#x2F;favicons?domain=ycombinator.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;s2&#x2F;favicons?domain=ycombinator.com</a><p>Putting this logic in the client is not feasible. You want to send requests directly to every shady site that shows up in your search results, load their pages in the background, work through network delays and HTTP errors, and parse out the location&#x2F;format of the favicon files?<p>DuckDuckGo hosting this functionality themselves is also a positive. They have previously been burned when the Web of Trust service they were originally using was found to be farming data, and turned it off immediately once discovered. Processing, hosting, and serving the icon themselves prevents that from happening again.<p>This is not to say that DDG is perfect: links you click do seem to be redirected through a &#x2F;l&#x2F; page on their domain, which can cause problems: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lapcatsoftware.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;duckduckgo.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lapcatsoftware.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;duckduckgo.html</a>",

Their privacy policy goes on about the privacy implications of Referer headers and instead of calling out browsers for sending Referer by default, they instead give themselves power to record all the user&#x27;s clicked results themselves.  The Referer problem is something that can be solved by the user at the browser level through, e.g., using a client that does not send Referer, browser extensions&#x2F;plug-ins that can control headers sent, or perhaps with a local proxy to remove the Referer header.<p>Unless DDG has changed, these prefixed result URLs are the default.  It is possible to get unprefixed result URLs using the &quot;lite&quot; version of DDG however that is not the default.  &quot;Privacy-focused&quot; search engine chooses less private default.  News at 11.<p>I recently noticed that DDG has started redirecting queries submitted via POST to &#x2F;lite&#x2F;.  The redirect is to the same domain.  No explanation.  I have a custom client that does not follow redirects and I now have to submit two sets of HTTP headers instead of one.<p>These guys are trying to make money from advertising just like everyone else.  They have to be very particular in the methods they use to do it -- check the exceptions in their privacy policy -- but it is the same game.  Ads and affiliate links.  That sort of business and privacy are always going to be at odds with each other.",

The &quot;food&quot; query returns a list of search results, these results have each have a link, DDG wants to display the favicon for each link.\n3. To be clear, DDG does not store or log the IP address of the user doing the query. They do, however, know what was queried, so they know &quot;somebody&quot; somewhere searched for &quot;food&quot;. They have to know this, they are a search engine after all.\n4. Since DDG wants to show the favicon &quot;privately&quot;, and they dont want to put that logic&#x2F;work on the client side (which could leak your IP), so instead DDG finds the favicon internally. \n5. A DDG server, completely separate from anything search-related is then tasked with finding the favicon for your &quot;food&quot; query results, lets say the #1 result is www.allrecipes.com, so a DDG server goes to www.allrecipes.com and finds the exact favicon location. \n6. The &quot;found&quot; favicons are then stored in a cache, and displayed from the cache like this: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;external-content.duckduckgo.com&#x2F;ip3&#x2F;www.allrecipes.com.ico\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;external-content.duckduckgo.com&#x2F;ip3&#x2F;www.allrecipes.c...</a> (and if no favicon is found in the local cache, you get a grey arrow by default)\n7. I&#x27;d like to note, even with all this action, DDG doesn&#x27;t know if you actually &quot;visited&quot; www.allrecipes.com, they simply know that some anonymous user did a search for &quot;food&quot;, www.allrecipes.com was a search result, and a favicon was displayed. They dont know who searched for it because the users IP is not stored anywhere, they dont know if you visited www.allrecipes.com, they prevented you from leaking your IP to allrecipes.com since they didn&#x27;t force the end user to load the favicon.<p>So whats the issue? What am I missing here?<p>PS: You know this works because after doing all these searches for food and seeing allrecipes.com (and even clicking allrecipes.com result in the DDG Mobile App or browser extension), guess what? allrecipes.com doesn&#x27;t follow you around with re-targeting ads! Why? Because DDG prevented that from happening!",
