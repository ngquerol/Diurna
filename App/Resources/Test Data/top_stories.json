Others publish smaller pieces of work frequently, at conferences, workshops etc. In this time the latter will have built up a public academic profile, while the former may be essentially anonymous to the field.

Unless all migratory birds are counted, their nests photographed, their legs tagged, their beaks measured and catalogued, it is as if they wouldn&#x27;t exist. This is considered a shortcoming, a deficit, and environmentalists organize &quot;bird tagging&quot; events where they try to remedy the situation. In traditional societies wildlife is just there, and it is fine to leave it &quot;illegible&quot;.",

The motivations given later seem laudable, but it troubles me that it should be considered wrong simply to not appear on any database. Probably not what was meant, but it sounds like it.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s shameful that we - as cartographers of the world - don&#x27;t take enough interest to even know where they are.<p>Shameful? Like, I should be ashamed of myself for mapping my local area, where I live and walk every day, rather than travelling to remotest Africa and mapping there? Again, I&#x27;m sure this isn&#x27;t what was meant, but that is literally what it says.<p>When reading further down the article it seems more sensible: giving the locals the tools and training needed to map the areas themselves.

Statistical techniques have dominated the field in recent ish\nyears but much work in machine learning has historically used e.g.\nProbabilistic Graphical Models or symbolic logic as the &quot;model&quot; language. e.g.\none of the most famous and well-studied classes of machine learning\nalgorithms, decision tree learners, comprises algorithms and systems that\nlearn propositional logic models, rather than statistical models.<p>Tom Mitchell defined machine learning as &quot;the study of computer algorithms\nthat improve automatically through experience&quot;[1]. This definition does not\nrely on any particular technique, other of course than the use of a computer.\nEven the nature of &quot;experience&quot; doesn&#x27;t necessarily need to mean &quot;data&quot; in the\nway that data scientists mean &quot;data&quot;- for example, &quot;experience&quot; could be\ncollected by an agent interacting with its environment, etc.<p>Unfortunately in very recent years, since the big success of Convolutional\nNeural Networks in image classification tasks, in 2012, interest for machine\nlearning has shifted from AI research to ... well, let me quote the article:<p>&gt;&gt; Or you can start reading TESL and try to get some of that sweet, sweet\nmachine learning dough from impressionable venture capitalists who hand out\nmoney like it\u2019s candy to anyone who can type a few lines of code.<p>I suppose that&#x27;s ironic. But the truth is that &quot;machine learning&quot; has very\nmuch lost its meaning as industry and academia is flooded by thousands of new\nentrants that do not know its history and do not undestand its goals. In that\ncontext, it makes sense to have questions along the lines of &quot;what is the\ndifference between statistics and machine learning&quot;, which otherwise have a\nvery obvious answer.<p>___________<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.cmu.edu&#x2F;~tom&#x2F;mlbook.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.cmu.edu&#x2F;~tom&#x2F;mlbook.html</a><p>The excerpt I quote is an informal definition.

It&#x27;s leveraging the occult (=hidden, incomprehensible parameters) for predicting the future. Because there exist no first principles, nothing can be further interpreted. Only more of the occult can be leveraged in order to make more predictions not amenable to interpretation, which will in turn require MORE occult to make MORE inscrutable predictions, until the heat death of the universe....<p>And appealing to 80&#x27;s AI (neural networks) as case precedence further harms the author&#x27;s case.

You need to index the dataset so that retrieving a specific slice is extremely fast - doing point in polygon tests, clipping operations on source geometries that have tens of thousands of vertices, etc should not happen at query time. This inevitably means pre-rendering as much as possible.<p>In addition, this needs to work for every intermediate tile level when zooming out - each parent tile covers 4 child tiles, so you need some strategy for decimating the amount of data so that the tile sizes don&#x27;t increase exponentially as you zoom out. This is beyond a pure computer programming problem and becomes a visual design problem as well - features such as roads or transit layers should form a sensible hierarchy with less important features removed.<p>I&#x27;ve been working on this class of problems for a couple years now and have a related presentation day 2 of the conference mentioned in TFA - details in bio if you&#x27;d like to talk more",

If you&#x27;re trying to serve a single website and map style, with limited traffic in one region, this fairly easily accomplished using a single map tile server using one of the established methods (something like 8 cores, 32GB of RAM, and a few hundred GBs of disk will get you most of the way there). The difficulty is mostly determine how you want to set it up and then provisioning the server to do it. This process will probably take you a few days. Updates will be infrequent, map data will be stale, and speed will be tolerable in your targeted geographic region.<p>2. Let&#x27;s say you take a step up. You need to serve global traffic with one style, but only a few requests &#x2F; second. You can still do this via a single tile server, but now you need a CDN to make it fast. Cache misses will be slow since it has to render and then send the tile to the CDN (up to 500ms of latency due to geographic constraints and cache fill times).<p>3. Let&#x27;s say you now need multiple styles, global traffic, 10s of tile requests &#x2F; second, and good reliabilty. Now you need to distribute your servers, so you&#x27;ll probably need three or four servers of at least the above mentioned specs, you need to keep them in sync.<p>4. Now let&#x27;s say you need multiple styles, global traffic, and up-to-date data. You&#x27;ll need to keep the OSM data stored locally so you can update it (minimum 500GB in Postgres + PostGIS). You need to distribute this all around the world. You need to handle updates, but do them in sync.<p>All of these are short of actually offering a commercial service for multiple companies, since in that case you need a global service structure, a CDN that&#x27;s pretty efficient, enough tile servers to handle spikes in demand (pretty common in map tile services), and probably a couple layers of cache to keep everything moving smoothly.<p>There are a few projects that make this easier. For instance, openmaptiles.org is what our solution was modeled after (and we still use their schema, mostly unchanged), but in the end it&#x27;s hard because it&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of data, that requires a <i>lot</i> of compute (either up-front or at a moments notice) to be responsive, and requires a lot of orchestration to keep it all well-oiled.",

Google Maps is still showing (and routing over) a trunk road in my home town that closed over a year ago.<p>&gt; A map of the world seems like sooo much work to keep updated<p>It&#x27;s really not that bad. Major infrastructure draws the attention of people who are fascinated by highways or railway tracks. The same goes for national cycling networks and  the roads and cycleways these use. Major administrative rearrangements (changes in the borders of municipalities etc.) also draw a particular group. And finally, local mappers care about their local piece of map, often down to the newest projects. As a local mapper myself I find it a joy to be the first to map a new street or add a newly assigned name to some unnamed way.<p>It&#x27;s also a nice hobby, because you visit parts of your town to survey you wouldn&#x27;t ever come otherwise.",

Which - let&#x27;s be honest - is often true of Wikipedia as well, moderators notwithstanding.<p>Improving OSM is an area of active research I believe, but I&#x27;d suggest the scale of the challenge is of a different magnitude than can be met by the type of ideas you mention. Think about something like Google Maps, or in the UK OS MasterMap. Each of these likely has hundreds of millions of R&amp;D invested in tools, techniques, processes and infrastructure behind them, as well as an ongoing budget in the hundreds of millions, and numerous, well organised, skilled, full time staff. There&#x27;s a critical mass behind such efforts that as yet OpenStreetMap has not been able to muster, which is no criticism of OSM, but just an acknowledgement of the reality of the situation. We&#x27;re talking about setups that take dedicated organisations years to develop - the history of the Ordnance Survey for example goes back to 1747!",

For free (technically for a revenue share, but I don&#x27;t sell my music)!<p>And unlike something like Spotify&#x2F;iTunes&#x2F;Soundcloud, the platform is not the dominant brand when someone visits my Bandcamp page.<p>On top of all this, Bandcamp&#x27;s been super generous with dropping their revenue share during the outbreak to help artists.<p>So yeah, I love everything about it. Bandcamp&#x27;s hands-down my favorite music publishing platform, no contest. Thanks and long may it continue!",

            "text": "Thanks for a great site - I love how shopping for music on Bandcamp feels quite personal. I particularly like that it is all based around the record label - especially in more niche genres, the labels are absolutely fundamental and there\u2019s a good chance that if you like a record, you\u2019ll find loads more interesting stuff on the same label.<p>For whatever reason, Spotify etc. seem to demote the existence of the label to a tiny font with no label \u201chome page\u201d or anything. You can search by label but it\u2019s pretty hidden and doesn\u2019t work 100%. I wonder if part of their long term plan is to remove labels from the equation...<p>Anyway, I was wondering if you had any plans for a public facing API to search your catalogue? I\u2019ve got loads of ideas for content discovery tools but the lack of an API makes them impractical. For example, I built this to find your top Spotify artists on Bandcamp, but without an API all it can do is link off to a search so it\u2019s quite a frustrating UX: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tomduncalf.github.io&#x2F;supportify&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tomduncalf.github.io&#x2F;supportify&#x2F;</a>",

My favorite was a rare Lloop album, and a remix album of The Irresistible Force&#x27;s track Nepalese Bliss. I always wanted a vinyl copy of Stryke - Introspection, I already have the CD version, but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, even on Discogs after all these years. I got a bunch of Higher Intelligence Agency stuff, too somewhere in a box.<p>It&#x27;s hard to know exactly when IDM turns into Ambient, and where Ambient can cross over to Triphop on that station, but I found a ton of amazing stuff from really niche artists like Global Communication, Mark Pritchard, who eventually got into the same Dubstep sound I was into later on and got his stuff released on one of the most venerates labels at the Time (DeepMedi). He even came from Australia and played at the Dub War nights in NY with Joe Nice.<p>I actually met Gel-Sol randomly in a chatroom, and he gave me a cut of his album with no strings attached [2] when I recognized his name back when I was an incoming freshman living in the dorms to listen and review while we spoke. I never saw him again after we spent all night talking about EDM&#x2F;IDM artists we liked and the album ahead of its release. My GF at the time just rolled her eyes and told me I could have just told her I didn&#x27;t want to hang out instead of making up some elaborate lie to stay in my room all night on the computer.<p>I just played Few and Far Between while updating this with links and it still puts a smile on my face remembering that night.<p>Those were crazy fun days that I&#x27;m still fond of, especially given where my musical tastes have gone throughout the years spanning&#x2F;DJ&#x27;ng dark deep UK halfstep 140&#x2F;170BPM and now into Darksynth and Dark Elctro as it doesn&#x27;t make any sense as I originally come from the chiller, cerebral, calmer IDM ambient side of EDM, too.<p>Here is another playlist with featured Groove salad tracks to check out [3].<p>Glad to see the Bandcamp guys checking in, thanks for what you do, guys!<p>1: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;somafm.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;somafm.com&#x2F;</a><p>2: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bOCSzUMn4MA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bOCSzUMn4MA</a><p>3: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;playlist?list=PLC92F5746C6D6A454\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;playlist?list=PLC92F5746C6D6A454</a>",

Specifically, Carpenter Brut&#x27;s stuff who released a really crazy film based [1] on its music video for Turbo Killer [2]. It&#x27;s worth checking out if you&#x27;re into rock-sounding synthwave with 80&#x27;s themed psychedelic visuals.<p>I&#x27;m also buying like 3 more to support artists.<p>ABout 7 years go now, Soundcloud enabled Bitcoin donations, and about a team of 5 guys includin me went on a tipping frenzy and tried to get adoption going that way. It was funny, because reddit allowed for direct Bitcoin donations there via a bot and you could name it whatever you wanted. So we did the same on Soundcloud, it&#x27;s funny because I log into my old soundcloud account at the History of them is still there.<p>Anyhow, I tipped like 20-30 guys on SC and even got some runway from an early adopter ($100?) to take it further and met a few EDM guys coming into Hollywood&#x2F;LA area for a few sets and tried to explain it to them as none of them picked up there funds. Apparently, Soundcould didn&#x27;t do a good job of notifying them that they had money waiting for them so ultimately it failed.<p>I ended up giving the Bits I had left into people who set up full nodes on the network. But I always thought, especially as a DJ myself, that supporting artists with micropayments would be a good solution. Youtube now allows for tipping in their chatbox as I saw a few in house performances&#x2F;sets be tipped by followers and fans, but it was always over $1+, which is awesome, but entirely impractical if you want people to send what little they may have on hand to listen a song&#x2F;remix&#x2F;dj set&#x2F;podcast for most people unless you have a very dedicated and quite frankly affluent followers. I&#x27;d rather have a 100k-million fans tip 10-50 cents then the four or five die-hards give $10 so I can continue to make content. Paetreon, Gofundme, Kickstarter and such are just needless middlemen at this point and hosting content is super cheap with even multimedia with a $5&#x2F;month vimeo account.<p>Anyhow, happy hunting tomorrow, I&#x27;m all digital now so I can buy and support a lot more music&#x2F;artists I otherwise had to ignore because of format.<p>1: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bloodmachines.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bloodmachines.com&#x2F;</a><p>2: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=er416Ad3R1g\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=er416Ad3R1g</a>",

Just out of curiosity, do the gulf carriers keep PIA in high regard and have a friendly relationship or they are continuously trying to bring it down?<p>Pakistani airlines were not the only ones whom Gulf carriers have brought down. They dominate the entire region, and rightfully so (aside from heavy subsidies.) Their service is superb.<p>PIA used to be a much more higher-end airline, and it was on top of global ranks before the troubles started in the country. A lot of Pakistan&#x27;s talent called it quit at that point, and immigrated en masse, aviation cadres included. A lot of them settled in the UAE, where they crossed paths with the gulf money, and set the foundation for many of Emirati airlines.<p>Naturally, conquering Pakistani market was very easy for them given their local knowledge.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t think PIA would be aware of fake licenses and keep them as well?<p>They would. The phenomenon started with Gen. Zia (who died in an airplane crash, ironically.) The country has been ruled by three political dynasties that effectively normalised the state when state companies were given away to children, relatives, and friends to be ran like family businesses.<p>A double digit of all professionals in the country are fake degree holders, and that&#x27;s not surprising in a country where now two generations of people were raised internalising the idea that earning money straight, and fair was made impossible as such, per-design.",

From what I have been told there was no official driving school&#x2F;education required in Virginia, neither in theory nor in practice. People could just show up for the tests. And at least the practice test was ridiculous: I drove a friend to his test and after 10min of circling around the DMV building the test was done. And consequently people drive really bad (at least in the NoVa region). No one knew anybody who failed the tests. This is all to say the Germany as well is willing to let it slide to a larger extent than I expected.<p>For comparison, to even register for theory and practice tests in Germany you need to have taken at least 12 90min lessons for the basics and 2 additional 90min lessons for extra topics, all in official driving schools. For the practice test you need at least 12 times 90min driving hours (5 regular roads, 4 autobahn, 3 at night). In average students take 15 practice hours. It is not so uncommon that people fail at theory or practice tests.",

It&#x27;s because the US is commonly using visual approaches kind of as a loophole to reduce separation. All major carriers require that crews use the ILS (or RNAV) as a backup to a visual approach if it&#x27;s available. But by clearing for a visual approach the controller is no longer required to keep the planes on approach separated.<p>I know a few European airlines that encourage their crews not to accept visual approaches in the US and request an ILS approach instead, because it&#x27;s safer.<p>Europe has solved the same &quot;we need more planes per hour&quot; problem by allowing a reduced 2.5nm separation when both planes are established in the localizer and are radar monitored by the controller.<p>As a pilot I prefer the European way, because it&#x27;s more structured and has a few more safeguards. The US method puts the problem with the pilot, who has far worse means to judge separation than the controller",

You can use it to see other planes on the navigation display, but you cannot legally call that &quot;visual separation&quot;.<p>If a controller asks you whether you have traffic in sight (they must ask that before they can tell you to follow it for example), you cannot say you have it on the screen.

They cost around $2 million (max) to install, so I don&#x27;t get it. Major US airports charge over $10,000 per landing, so they can afford to maintain navaids.<p>The other notable thing was that the pilots sat stunned in the cockpit after the accident (likely knowing their careers were over), and a stewdardess took charge and ordered the evacuation after 90 seconds passed.",

If they got delayed at JFK, they&#x27;re more likely to blame the airline, etc.<p>I&#x27;m thinking of digging into this a bit further as I think some of this explains why certain programming languages, tools, and services grow in popularity while others don&#x27;t. AWS feels like the JFK of clouds, for instance. There&#x27;s also the old &quot;no-one gets fired for buying IBM&quot; adage at play.<p>People pick AWS or JFK not because it&#x27;s the <i>best</i> option but because it&#x27;s guaranteed by popularity to not be the worst.",

Instead of .WidgetType() wrappers, Guietta infers widget type based on List element type and string formatting rules. The resulting column aligned code has the visual look and feel of a grid&#x2F;table and makes it very readable. The choice of Qt-only seems reasonable.<p>There is probably a category of DSLs that try to mimic a grid&#x2F;table layout rather than a natural language DSL (many Ruby style Internal DSLs).
