Most of them are from 2012-2013.<p>Now will be some rant and justification for the question, the question itself is in the last paragraph.<p>At the time (2012-2013) I was very hyped and enthusiastic, imagining new courses of the same quality and kind will be appearing at the same rate in future. By kind I mean university level subjects, fundamental topics that have high return of investment.<p>But it seems to me it went quite differently. I don&#x27;t really see any new courses being published and recommended on the lists among good oldies. My own experience with stuff that came later also wasn&#x27;t as pleasant, I started dropping courses much more often.<p>The platforms themselves changed significantly:\n1. Switch from fundamental to hands-on subjects like technologies and frameworks.\n2. Switching to paid model (not that I have anything against it, although being poor in a poor country I avoid paying as much as I can and haven&#x27;t paid for a single certificate). This leads to less people checking out the course and giving it a &quot;media coverage&quot;.\n3. Switching from strict start-end date to &quot;take anytime you want&quot;. Because of that the social element for me has been essentially lost, the forums are half-dead.\n4. Increased amount of courses. Together with (1) this makes it hard to find something by random exploration. When I open edx computer science section I have to go through pages and pages of microsoft courses about their technologies.<p>This made me gradually lose interest in MOOCs and switch to books and self-learning. I occasionally go back to MOOC platforms or MOOC aggregators, thinking maybe I just missed something or something interesting came out recently.<p>Did you take any good (valuable, mind-expanding, long-term rewarding, intellectually stimulating) courses that aren&#x27;t famous and have a high chance of being overlooked?",

And, more broadly, how can we (as technologists) foster that sort of collegiate culture online, given the global scope of the Internet, the permanence of anything we post, and the inherent anonymity of the Internet stack.<p>I have a strong desire right now to 1) be a part of and reinforce existing communities with this ethos and 2) advocate for technology and culture that could make this the norm.",

There are psychological mechanisms to isolate &quot;otherness&quot; out of people you witness as &quot;bad&quot;, you will just use the easiest one to pinpoint.

But that seems... extreme (e.g. it means that two people can&#x27;t have a discussion, since two people will never approximately represent all of the groups making up our society). Perhaps you could clarify your claim?",

The whole &#x27;grey tribe&#x27; distinction was often used in a more defensive&#x2F;obscurantist and less productive&#x2F;illuminating way than in Scott&#x27;s original formulation.

You mention having a trans person present at the table. However, if you&#x27;re a psychologist and you&#x27;re characterizing mental disorders like gender dysphoria, you don&#x27;t invite a trans person to the table as an equal with whom you&#x27;re going to come to some compromise pleasing to both (in practice, pleasing to the trans person). This is not political negotiation, it&#x27;s an attempt at knowing the truth. Sadly, we&#x27;ve made truth a kind of &quot;what&#x27;s the narrative we can all agree on&quot; (in practice, &quot;that the loudest bully is willing to accept&quot;[0]). Conversation is ultimately about trying to get to the truth. By bringing the trans person to the table as an equal and not as a patient presumes the legitimacy of trans beliefs which are precisely that which is at issue. If someone, trans or not, wishes to make arguments in favor of their position, by all means, but one&#x27;s, shall we say, identity does not take the place of reasoned argument.<p>[0] This is what happened with the DSM and same-sex attraction.

A lot of what has kept it functional for over a decade is the focus on tech.  It&#x27;s not followed to the letter, but an attempt to make HN into SSC would probably destroy it.  It&#x27;s valuable enough as it is, so let&#x27;s not take the chance.<p>The bright part is that (so far as I can tell) if one could attract the core community, SSC should be fairly portable.   Scott&#x27;s top posts were sometimes really good, but I don&#x27;t think they were essential.   I&#x27;m tempted that the right approach may be just to create a new space, advertise it, and try to attract enough of the core community to jump start it.<p>I picture it to be like capturing a swarm of bees:  put a large cardboard box under the tree limb that they are hanging from, give it a sharp shake, seal up the box, take it to a new location, and install in a new hive.  If you managed to capture a viable queen in the transfer, you are done!  If not, you need to get the swarm to accept a new queen, with a process that involves exposure to the new queen&#x27;s pheremones (and sometimes marshmallows --- I&#x27;m a little fuzzy on the details).<p>If one was to take that approach (metaphorically) where would you begin?

Helen Pluckrose and Kathleen Stock both experience a backlash on Twitter for participating in their dialogue on trans&#x2F;gender issues. Interestingly, they both reported that the backlash was predominantly from their own audience&#x2F;tribe. Neither of them were particularly bothered by it.<p>A criticism I\u2019ve heard with regards to the platform is that it appears to be aligned or associated with the Intellectual Dark Web. This is true to the extent that we strongly value free speech and good faith dialectic, but we don\u2019t have loyalties to any particular group, and we welcome (and are actively trying to host) conversations with people from all sides of the ideological and political spectrum.<p><i>One thing that I notice in your platform somehow is a sort of I-Thou dynamic\u2026 Surely that militates against tribalism\u201d</i><p>Thanks for noticing. We\u2019ve put a lot of effort into nudging writers to engage in good faith. Little things seem to have a big effect. For example, the default text on the letter writing page is \u201cDear NAME,\u201d.<p><i>surely some people are mad that some of the conversations are happening at all? (&quot;Why is this person&#x2F;platform legitimizing this terrible person by having this letter exchange?&quot;</i><p>This hasn\u2019t been a significant issue, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see more of this as we grow. It\u2019s not something we\u2019re particularly worried about; my co-founders and I are happy to defend the primacy of free speech and the importance of dialogue.<p><i>Are you afraid that you&#x27;ll be tempted to refuse certain letter exchanges because their topics are too intense or too taboo somehow,</i><p>No. In fact, we\u2019ve actively worked to foster difficult conversations - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.impossibleconversations.info\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.impossibleconversations.info</a><p><i>...or because you&#x27;re not sure the participants are interacting in good faith? Are you sort of at peace with the prospect of having to make that judgment?</i><p>We fully support writers&#x27; freedom of speech, and we do not censor content or ban users unless legally or ethically necessary (child porn, doxxing, fraud, and direct &amp; credible threats of violence). If we\u2019re convinced that a writer is acting in bad faith we\u2019ll flag their account, and their content will only appear on their own profile.<p><i>How are people finding the platform and finding each other? Are you reaching out to them based on their prior reputations? Is someone suggesting your site to pairs of people who&#x27;ve been in social media fights, or seemed to be on the verge of them? Are people finding it themselves by word of mouth?</i><p>It\u2019s a mix of all of these. When we launched, a little over a year ago, all of the conversations were initiated by me or someone on my team reaching out to writers. Now, the vast majority of our conversations happen organically: writers typically discover Letter via conversations shared to Twitter, and they invite other writers by starting conversations with them. We still do outreach, but limit our attention to high status writers.<p><i>How many of the participants do you think have some kind of celebrity or substantial following outside of your site? Do you think that makes things better or worse in some way?</i><p>The majority of our most popular writers have a following on Twitter, but our average writer doesn\u2019t. Popular writers help with distribution, and the quality of their writing tends to be higher. As you might guess, there\u2019s a strong correlation between the quality and expertise of a writer, and their popularity.<p><i>How do these exchanges compare to, say, a podcast video interview?</i><p>Good question. There are pros and cons to both formats. Audio is great because a lot of meaning is conveyed in tone, inflection, etc, and you often get a better sense of a speakers\u2019 personality. The cons are that the conversation comes at you at the speed of mouth, and there\u2019s a pressure to respond promptly. Podcast guests often feel a performative pressure, and they might misspeak, or convey an idea or argument less eloquently than they might\u2019ve otherwise. Letter conversations, being asynchronous and written, provides writers the time to fully consider and understand their interlocutor\u2019s position before responding, and enables them to present their best possible argument.<p><i>I did an SSC adversarial collaboration last year and my collaborator, and now friend, later interviewed me for his podcast, which felt like a pretty nice format too.</i><p>We\u2019re currently exploring this format: a Letter conversation followed by a moderated, digital live event, which is live streamed and recorded. Our vision for Letter is to be the best place for conversation in any medium.<p>FYI, two of our writers, Buster Benson and BJ Campbell used Letter to flesh out their SSC Adversarial Collaboration submission on gun policy: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;letter.wiki&#x2F;conversation&#x2F;129\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;letter.wiki&#x2F;conversation&#x2F;129</a><p>Edit: fixed formatting &amp; typo",

Stock is a feminist philosopher who regards gender self-identity as potentially harmful to the interests of women.

There was a meta-moderation system to calibrate the moderators.  The site was better than HN at showing only upvoted comments by default, in case you just wanted to see the highlights.  (Oh, and I think it would send email for belated replies, making it better for ongoing discussion -- something I&#x27;ve definitely missed here at HN.)<p>Although the site is pretty dead now -- it doesn&#x27;t have HN&#x27;s advantage of a wealthy benefactor keeping it ad-free -- its original incarnation had some good ideas.",

Just for the simple reason that people want to contribute. Probably split agreement&#x2F;quality moderation is desirable and then crafting individual feeds so that you see quality posts you will probably disagree with more so than low-quality posts that you will probably disagree with. Threaded forums like HN also seem to get better contributions than person-based social media.)",

            "text": "I&#x27;m a participant on a political discussion forum that enforces strong civility norms (eg anti-snark), and it very much works. It&#x27;s very popular these days to say that civility norms are a Trojan horse for enforcing conformity. But the breadth of viewpoints I&#x27;ve seen expressed there is 10x as high as anywhere else, and conversations are consistently polite, insightful, and intellectually honest. It turns out that filtering out stupidity and emotional incontinence leads to adult conversation.<p>More importantly, the norms make any given person feel safe acting like an adult, even if they&#x27;d otherwise be inclined not to. This is a big problem with much Internet discourse: putting thought and nuance into a comment and taking your interlocutor seriously is easily deflated with mockery and disdain for &quot;tryhards&quot; or &quot;effortposting&quot;. The natural equilibrium is obviously going to be that even people inclined towards intellectual honesty end up in the mud flinging shit at others. Consistent, high-quality moderation around civility prevents the temperature from rising and allows you to actually learn something from every exchange. (It doesn&#x27;t hurt that the filter effect of these norms mean that the average commenter ends up pretty intelligent: even when someone is wrong, I tend to learn something)<p>Tldr: the norms you&#x27;re describing work very well IME",

Most of us generally have some sort of impulse to build consensus and seek some sort of middle ground. It&#x27;s just a foundational aspect of social animals in general, I believe.<p>That breaks down when you throw bad actors -- either because they are intentionally behaving in antisocial ways, or because they are profoundly detached from reality -- into the mix.<p>For an example of the former, our impulse for consensus-building and compromise doesn&#x27;t work if your buddy says &quot;let&#x27;s go murder ten people for no reason.&quot; It would not be a sane compromise to murder five people, or perhaps find ten people and beat them precisely halfway to death.<p>For an example of the latter, there can be no compromise with certain pseudoscience beliefs.

Any place that wanted to focus on high quality discussion should probably try to avoid that or else become the murky waters of insults or groupthink, but then we seem to be stuck in recursion.<p>(It seems that in a high quality forum, a person on the right should only be able to make generalisations about people on the right, and a person on the left should only be able to make generalisations about people on the left, unless the post has been moderated and approved as high quality. Not that such terms hold much content in any case, and they&#x27;re far better avoided entirely.

        "text": "One thing is nuance and truth. There&#x27;s a lot of people capable of intellectual honesty who can argue about a topic with healthy levels of nuance if they are in the right state of mind, if they have time, peace and motivation to do it. This could be collected in magazines and other publications... well, at least if this kind of nuance and truth could be consistently valuable to a broad public. But it&#x27;s not just that it&#x27;s hard to tell apart this kind of content, but rather that we learn at very different rates, derive value from very different ideas, and the rest can quickly and easily become &quot;noise&quot; for us, while it&#x27;s not for others. Some authors are original enough to combine new ideas with nuance and intellectual honesty, and those cases might be very interesting, but you can&#x27;t really expect that in high and sustained doses. SSC was interesting in this sense, plenty of books are interesting in this sense, but they are mostly individual voices.<p>Another completely different thing is trying to build communities around those values. And even then, one thing is the real world, educating children to be rational, intellectually honest, critical... another thing is creating small physical communities with that kind of people, and yet another is creating &quot;large scale&quot;, open, highly visible spaces that still have consistently high quality contributions. This last case seems unlikely to me. You either require large scale moderation, with all the potential problems that that involves (logistically, morally, and for the scope of the discussions [I still think it tends to be better than no moderation. Small communities are naturally moderated by the fact that no one interested enough in a topic will get to find the community]), or you need everyone to be intellectuals with similar priorities and a strict discipline to shut up unless you are in the best conditions to contribute (have something useful to contribute and they are in an emotionally stable state when they can best fight against their own biases and whatever). Both seem pretty impossible.<p>Other approaches are possible, though, and have been used in many cases in similar and different contexts. Basically, entry doors to large communities that interact in smaller subgroups. Take forums and threads, reddit, google itself where you can search whatever you want but end up in a random blog, etc. The main issue is structuring information and interests in an accessible way &#x2F; discoverability, standardizing the interaction methods... but there will still be a lot of noise. You could try with other ideas like allowing authors or discussion starters to filter by themselves the answers, and have both filtered and unfiltered discussions, so readers can access to &quot;highly curated&quot; discussions on the topics they enjoy, while also being able to switch to the mess that real interaction inevitably can become (and with it, the broader perspective, which can only ever be fuzzy and noisy).",

The big issues are lack of content or early swarming from one political group (which then deters the \u201cother side\u201d from joining). Parler, a Twitter alternative, has this issue. I\u2019m nevertheless trying it out just to give it a shot. But we might need a tool to manage the process of achieving quorum on what platform interested people move to.

I do things like this because I find the existing search tools to achieve what I&#x27;d like to be inadequate.<p>Also as I write this I&#x27;m listening to a music crawler I&#x27;ve built that tries to navigate and cross-reference through currently 260 music labels and about 12,000 releases in order for me to find new music (using discogs, bandcamp, etc). This is just running on my laptop. Again, I&#x27;ve found the current music discovery systems inadequate to my desires so I built my own.<p>I don&#x27;t know how to stand out from the pile.

Ultimately, all applications have to go through usajobs, but I can work with my hiring manager and a candidate to push-pull them through the system. I still have to compete the solicitation and interview qualified candidates, so if there is another more qualified candidate, the applicant may still leave the process without a job.<p>That said, having been through various versions of this process since 2004, it is <i>extremely</i> valuable to get visibility on candidates who may feel &quot;stuck outside the system&quot;. Not only is it increasingly the case that the best candidates are precisely the ones who feel stuck outside, I can&#x27;t advocate to fix the system without putting those cases in front of the HR people who are responsible for the system.<p>If a federal manager is giving you an email inbox for their applications, they are begging for your help. If you want a job, sending email to that inbox is helping them, and they will appreciate it.",

Your employer likely shares important details about your employment, including your title, job duration, and wages, with third party credit agencies to fulfill these requests. Unfortunately, this process is not transparent for employees and can be slow and error-prone for employers and verifiers.<p>Truework is building a modern, consent-driven employment and income verification platform to give employees visibility and control into how their employment information is shared with others. We are growing quickly and currently handle thousands of verifications every month, which have enabled the approval of billions of dollars in loans and help employees in regulated professions (e.g. nursing) start work more quickly than before.<p>Our engineering team is still small, which means you\u2019ll play big a part in shaping the future of Truework, and your work will have a significant impact and visibility. We are a Django and React (Typescript) shop, and run our infrastructure on AWS.

Governments post their RFPs on our system and we alert a network of suppliers. Suppliers love us because we aggregate hundreds of government buyers on one site (otherwise they&#x27;d have to check all those city, county, municipal, school, and utility sites individually... every day), which means more opportunities for work. Governments love us because we increase the number of suppliers bidding on their work, which means lower prices and taxpayer savings.<p>Our 7 person team has experience as state and federal employees doing procurement, experience doing sales in the government and small business space, and experience building and growing startups.<p>We already have 500+ governments and tens of thousands of paying suppliers using the platform. We have a healthy amount of revenue, and just raised a $2M round from Version One, Forefront, and Advance Venture Partners to fuel product growth.<p>We have product&#x2F;market fit. We have revenue. We have money. We just need you.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a product-centric CTO to take the reigns of our existing product and grow the domestic engineering team.

I come from an ad-tech background where the general theme was to use loads of data to help advertising be &quot;more efficient&quot;... which is to say we tried to help sell folks on things they usually didn&#x27;t need... meanwhile in spite of noble aspirations to clean up the industry, ad-tech has gotten creepier over the last 10 years.  (I&#x27;m glad there are still folks working on that problem.)  But today I&#x27;m so happy now to be directing my effort toward a somewhat surprising opportunity to A) benefit humans and B) be more efficient from a cost perspective.  The general idea is that we find cases where providing behavioral health care (think treatment for SUD, anxiety or depression) has a very good chance of improving the management of one or more chronic conditions (think diabetes, COPD, asthma, etc).  I don&#x27;t want to over-sell it as a mythical win-win-win (the individual, the insurance companies, and our company), but so far the model is working pretty well.  We&#x27;re growing both in terms of business as well as our capabilities.<p>My team of 2 is looking for 2 more to join our fully remote team.  If you&#x27;re a thoughtful, experienced practitioner who has built successful (and let&#x27;s face it maybe a few unsuccessful) ML or AI systems, you might be perfect.  If you&#x27;re searching this post for buzzwords, as a means of shameless SEO I&#x27;ll mention Python, Tensorflow, Keras, Spark, Scala,  SageMaker, Deep Learning, RNN, LSTM, R, ggplot, and (why not) Flask.  Note that we may or may not use all of these _right now_ (the team is new and much TBD), but I&#x27;m hoping to catch the attention of the right folks in the midst of so many job HN postings.<p>Ping me via LinkedIn messaging or my email (dlarsen at the company domain name) if you&#x27;re curious about the role.  Having recently joined the company and this team, a lot of the considerations that are probably on your mind as a job seeker are fresh in my mind as well, and I&#x27;d be happy to have a candid conversation about the company, the role and how you might fit in.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paycomonline.net&#x2F;v4&#x2F;ats&#x2F;web.php&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;ViewJobDetails?job=26656\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paycomonline.net&#x2F;v4&#x2F;ats&#x2F;web.php&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;ViewJobDeta...</a>",

Machine learning has struggled in early stage drug discovery efforts because most of these efforts do not have enough data for the models to parse. Our technology solves the data problem with massively parallel biochemistry in the form of DNA Encoded Libraries (DELs), allowing us to analyze 100-1000x more compounds compared to traditional approaches. By feeding our algorithms with this data we can identify better compounds faster than competing solutions. We recently closed a substantial seed investment (2+ years runway) and are assembling a highly interdisciplinary team of both bench and computational scientists. Come help us build the future of drug discovery!<p>Lead ML Engineer: We are looking for our first computational hire who in time will help build and manage this team. This person will be driving technology choices, designing and building data architectures and building models. These systems will take in raw experimental data as well as other information from lab instruments and integrate that data into models predicting several biochemically relevant properties. Familiarity with current ML and data pipeline tools is a must. We favor python, but aren\u2019t dogmatic.<p>Computational Chemist: We are looking for a computational chemist to create a cutting edge drug discovery toolchain. We strongly favor open platforms such as RDKit but are open to alternatives that maximize performance. This person should be familiar with traditional SAR, structure based drug discovery, ADME prediction and have some exposure to more recent ML applications to drug discovery.<p>These roles are both asking a lot, and correspondingly we offer strong equity and competitive compensation. The roles are also a unique opportunity to build systems correctly from the ground up to solve a really important problem!<p>Odds and ends:<p>Interview process is generally a few phone&#x2F;video conversations and some small practicum work, but is adapted to the individual at this stage of the company.<p>Onsite is expected to be in SF though we may have a site in Boston as well eventually. Of course, given the pandemic all office decisions are in the air, and the company is remote for the time being.<p>We offer healthcare coverage and typical technology startup benefits.<p>Email at nicolas at anagenex.com",

We\u2019re the authors of Fullstack React, ng-book, Fullstack Vue and we\u2019re looking to work with authors like you to write a few new courses this year. Our books &amp; courses sell very well because: - We go way beyond API docs and teach everything you need to know to build real apps. - We guarantee they&#x27;re up-to-date. - We invest in marketing the books (and have an active email list of over 100k) - We love the topics we write about and aim to create something remarkable every time.<p>If you decided to self-publish, you may find the marketing is more than writing the course. We have an audience, and we know what they want to learn - so when your course is done, we already have people who want to buy it.<p>If you decide to go with a \u201ctraditional\u201d publisher, you may be given a mediocre editor, write your book in MS Word (ha), and earn 5-15% in royalties.

        "text": "Symmetry Investments | Senior Software Engineers and DevOps | REMOTE or VISA (London, Hong Kong, Singapore) | D, Julia, Kotlin, other functional and systems languages | Full-Time, Fixed Term, Flexible\nSymmetry Investments is a post startup c. 5bn alternative asset management company with around 175 people across multiple time zones and locations. Our core technology team has been remote first for some time, and the whole company is following suit, post-COVID.<p>I&#x27;m one of the three people running the firm, responsible amongst other things for technology across the firm and I\u2019m posting this myself. That should give you an idea both about how seriously we take technology and the culture of the firm.<p>We are three years into a period of transformation from initially a fairly standard enterprise finance approach to technology to something new that recognises the importance of both the humane and the technical for discretionary portfolio management and for the business of running an alternative investment manager.<p>It&#x27;s not easy to integrate practitioners who may spend most of their day programming but are oriented towards solving their business problems with developers who are specialists in programming. To achieve this, we wrote a little functional DSL that&#x27;s now in production. Type inference of returns and parameters using inequality constraints is in a feature branch and there is plenty more to do on the language itself as well as the ecosystem around it. What might be a project in itself elsewhere can be just a set of functions in Symmetry Integration Language.<p>The language is written in D, we hosted dconf last year and will do so again this year. So we are looking for outstanding native code developers who would like to write D as well as people to work with practitioners writing Symmetry Integration Language. Also looking for people to write documentation and work on the build.<p>It&#x27;s quite a creative place where we encourage a degree of courage amidst practical constraints, and we are open to doing things a different way if it&#x27;s commercially sound and in the interests of our investors.<p>We look for virtues and capabilities over only experience and credentials although those things aren&#x27;t a disadvantage. Do not let a lack of credentials or qualifications prevent you from applying. We&#x27;ve recently hired experts with C++, Common Lisp, D, Haxe, Julia and Perl backgrounds, and are happy to bring them up to speed with our stack.<p>Compensation is currently not quite at Netflix standards but is generous to very generous over time by broad technology industry standards. We recognise and reward technical accomplishment and have a very flat structure.<p>Some Symmetry people: All Spreadsheets Must Die (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;FZi9CSB9_kk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;FZi9CSB9_kk</a>), Lessons from a DSL where all you have is Ranges (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=BtuzSlKRmzA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=BtuzSlKRmzA</a>), Alternative Investment Management (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;1rMq-4rWgis\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;1rMq-4rWgis</a>)<p>Please see our GitHub (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;symmetryinvestments\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;symmetryinvestments</a>), blog.dlang.org and Symmetry Autumn of Code (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dlang.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;25&#x2F;saoc-2019-projects-and-par...\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dlang.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;25&#x2F;saoc-2019-projects-and-par...</a>)<p>Email laeeth at kaleidic.io and cc jthompson at symmetryinvestments dot com.",

Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack! (see below). [NOTE: this is not a pie-in-the-sky venture, you would be joining a team who has a 1.5+year-old working product, with prospects of new greenfield products built around the first.]<p>Job positions:<p>- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don&#x27;t already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and&#x2F;or githubActions is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well; with Pulumi and RedHat&#x27;s OpenShift.)<p>- C#&#x2F;.NET developer: generics, LINQ, VisualStudio, EntityFramework et al are your bread and butter. You value the diversity that comes from learning other languages and tech-stacks but also the stability that a robust platform like .NET provides, which you based your career on. Desirable to be familiar with Xamarin, but not required. F# is a plus.<p>- Rust developer: you dealt with C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Objective-C in the past but are ready to move on. However, you&#x27;re still not convinced about garbage collected languages, so you have been looking at Rust lately, or willing to learn it. You&#x27;re not a smart-ass though, so you would be excited to expose your Rust code&#x27;s API to be consumed by higher level languages.<p>- FP developer: you value immutability and lack of side effects because you have lived the nightmares of race conditions and heisenbugs in your career. You&#x27;re disgusted with most job positions out there because the tech-stack described in most of them don&#x27;t look safe enough to be serious (sure they can build snapchats with them, but not robust software that would end up being used by NASA or Waymo). Desirable to be familiar with F#.<p>- Desktop&#x2F;mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of &quot;Electron apps&quot;, because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer and more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)<p>- SmartContracts&#x2F;blockchain developer: you&#x27;ve used&#x2F;developed smart contracts in languages such as Ivy, MiniScript, or Solidity(EVM), or are willing to learn this technology. Desirable to have familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs. Excited about things like bitcoin-lightning, ethereum, mimblewimble&#x2F;grin, DAI, etc<p>- Browser-extension developer: you would be interested in diving into the world of WebAssembly to create a similar opensource plugin like the UI of MetaMask (ideally this work should be compatible with Brave, Chrome&#x2F;Chromium, and Firefox).<p>Important perk for all positions: all the code&#x2F;scripts you&#x27;ll write (being paid of course) will be opensource, at least for the first 2months.<p>Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com<p>PS: Abstain from applying if you expect a lead&#x2F;managerial role, because the team is not yet big enough to need extra leadership for now.<p>PS II: In case you&#x27;re only interested in joining part-time, note: I wouldn&#x27;t find it acceptable if you join us to work remotely part-time while keeping your full-time job. Part-time only works in parallel with: a) your own side-projects, or b) other additional part-time job (because resting is important).",

Our user base is growing exponentially (now &gt;120k) and includes a wide range of people, from students who are just encountering materials science for the first time, to academic researchers and industry users. We\u2019re now in the process of building a new frontend for the website to meet some key needs that have arisen as the project has grown, as well as to share some of the latest data we\u2019ve been generating which will require deep thought in how best to make this data accessible and understandable to the broadest possible audience. If this sounds exciting to you, please get in touch. The Materials Project was founded in 2011.<p>Technologies: This is a good time to start working with us since we&#x27;re at the early stages of designing our new frontend, and you will have an opportunity to help us shape what that looks like. We&#x27;ve settled on React and TypeScript for our core technologies, and are committed to modern best practices where possible. Due to the large number of Python developers in our team, we will also be making heavy use of the Plotly Dash framework, and extending this using custom React components, so some Python familiarity will also be useful. All the code we write is open source &lt;3 you can find our code at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;materialsproject\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;materialsproject</a><p>Team: You will be joining a small team of four core developers, along with a larger research group of many postdocs and graduate students here at LBL, and also interacting with our collaborators worldwide.\nCOVID statement: This is an on-site job, however we are currently working remote and have been given guidance to expect this to continue until the end of September.<p>The official job ad, further details on how to apply, and our equal employment opportunity statement are all available here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lbl.referrals.selectminds.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;web-developer-the-materials-project-2787\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lbl.referrals.selectminds.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;web-developer-the...</a><p>Please note that this ad is a re-post from June, and we are currently interviewing candidates.

Between Memorial Day and Labor Day, we close our offices at 2pm on Fridays to enjoy the weather and time with family&#x2F;friends. We practice no-meeting Wednesdays, have year-round family time blocked off on Wednesday evenings, each quarter take a day off for a fun culture event in each office, as well as a quarterly mini-conference where our team hosts talks on everything from building an e-commerce side hustle to how to make great hummus at home. We have flexible PTO and remote work options, fully-paid healthcare premiums for employees and generous family coverage, 4% 401k match, gym stipend, transit&#x2F;parking stipend, and when our offices are operating again we keep a fully-stocked kitchen in each (well beyond just snacks). While our offices are closed due to COVID, we are donating our office food budget to local food banks. Visa sponsorship is an option if required.<p>If you&#x27;re an experienced Ruby developer and the above sounds attractive, please feel free to email me your resume or with any other questions: seth.hochberg AT stringandkey DOT com.

Remember what you read about the Michael Spindler &amp; Gil Amelio days of fragmentation, funnels, reorgs, canned projects, the head not knowing what the hands are doing ... I know apple is sitting on a lot of cash but everything felt like IBM&#x27;s PS&#x2F;2 days. I don&#x27;t know how you appraise the value of your time, but the more I learned, the lower I placed Apple. Once you get an equivalent to the &quot;gang of 9&quot; working around them I believe they&#x27;re fucked. YMMV, I went in with high hopes and yeah, eventually realized what I saw <i>was</i> the reality.<p>Their consumer marketing is still slick but once you pull back the cover it&#x27;s a mess. Look at how they still haven&#x27;t corrected their post.",
