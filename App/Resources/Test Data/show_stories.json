    "text": "Hey everyone! We\u2019re Alpha, Matt and Aaron, co-founders of PostEra (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;postera.ai&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;postera.ai&#x2F;</a>). The title above is quite a mouthful (we used all 80 characters) so we&#x27;ll begin by breaking down what it means.<p>What is medicinal chemistry? It\u2019s part of discovering new drugs. A drug hunter decides what disease to focus on and then selects \u2018targets\u2019: usually proteins whose activity is key to the disease. Then they look for a molecule that can \u2018hit\u2019 that target and stimulate a response which will hopefully have beneficial effects. Developing such a molecule that is potent and safe is medicinal chemistry.<p>Despite it being a crucial part of drug development, this field has relied on trial-and-error approaches\u2014a very expensive way to muddle toward a drug. Where computational tools have been used, they have emphasized the &#x27;best&#x27; designs without any awareness of what it would take to physically make the drug in a lab and test it. Our approach is to apply computational methods that know how to make these designs.<p>We\u2019ve been working on developing machine learning tools to advance the field for the last 3 years. Alpha formed a lab at Cambridge in 2017 to apply machine learning to drug discovery. Matt joined the group and soon some exciting results began to emerge, particularly in the area of how to make molecules. We published the first model to outperform trained human chemists in predicting the outcomes of chemical reactions. Alpha then got Aaron, his former mathematics classmate and debate partner at Oxford to leave his job for the world of drug discovery.<p>We decided to focus on the one challenge that exists at almost every step: molecules need to be made. No matter how clever it looks on paper, a molecule is worthless unless it can be tested in a lab. The task of actually making molecules, known as chemical synthesis, is often a challenging problem, involving the combinatorial explosion of games like Go with moves that can\u2019t be defined in a simple rulebook.<p>You start with a set of simple molecules which can be combined through chemical reactions (a \u2018move\u2019) to form more and more complex molecules, known as the \u2018route\u2019, until you arrive at your desired drug candidate. But how to combine these molecules? Trial and error is not an option, given the enormous cost of doing chemistry, and just enumerating all options to a client is unhelpful given that your average molecule can have hundreds of theoretically-possible routes. Searching this tree of routes and scoring the viability of such routes is where ML becomes very powerful.<p>We developed a machine-translation approach which takes in reactants and outputs the product of a reaction; an approach very similar to how Google Translate operates. This allows us to score the viability of each move. We combine this with fast tree search algorithms, used in models like AlphaGo to efficiently search the large combinatorial space of possible reactions.<p>To get this technology in front of users, we&#x27;re building a cloud-based platform. Clients input the molecule they want to be made, our system designs a route for how to make it, and then the client can order this molecule through our platform. We don\u2019t own a lab, but we partner with chemical manufacturers around the world who execute the routes we design. Combining automated chemical synthesis with compound ordering creates a better experience for the drug hunter who wants to focus on their science and just wants a vial with their compound without the cumbersome process of figuring out how to make it and where to get it from.<p>All that is what we were working on until the pandemic hit... and now we can answer the second part of the title: COVID Moonshot.<p>We had just finished YC W20 when a tweet from a team of scientists quickly changed our travel (and company) trajectory. A team of scientists at Diamond Light Source in the UK had shown that a selection of chemical fragments were effective at binding to a key part of the COVID virus. We realised there were hundreds of chemists sitting at home, with their projects on hold, who could help take these fragments and turn them into genuine drug candidates\u2014an open-science approach to crowdsourcing a new drug. We created a platform where designs could be submitted and hoped for maybe 50 to 100 submissions. In the first few weeks, we\u2019ve received over 4000 submissions from 200 scientists around the world.<p>This was the start of a COVID Moonshot initiative that we are now helping lead. It is an international consortium of scientists drawn from academia, biotechs, and pharma, all working pro bono or at cost with no IP claims on any resulting drug candidates. The aim is to find an antiviral candidate for COVID-19 by the end of the year\u2014a \u2018moonshot\u2019 of a time frame compared with the standard drug discovery paradigm.<p>That standard paradigm is unfortunately broken when it comes to pandemic-related diseases. Biology and chemistry are hard enough, but things become even intractable when there are little or no commercial incentives to develop new therapies. Sadly, this explains why promising antibiotic companies like Achaogen go bankrupt and why, even after SARS-CoV brought the Far East to a halt in 2003, we still didn\u2019t invest in coronavirus therapies during the last 17 years. For therapies that only become critical once every few decades, we need a new approach to developing drugs.<p>We think that drug hunters can learn something from the CS community and its embrace of open source. Similarly to open-source software development, someone has to manage the roadmap and triage suggestions. For Moonshot, the candidate drug submissions are great but we obviously can\u2019t make and test all of them, so how do you pick the most promising ones? Here is where our technology comes in: it can identify which candidates can be <i>synthesized</i> easily. Since in a pandemic you need to move quickly, prioritizing compounds that can be synthesized easily is a natural triaging mechanism. Where a human chemist would take 3-4 weeks, we were able to design synthetic routes for all submissions within 48 hours. The top route designs were then passed on to our chemical manufacturing partner for synthesis. We\u2019ve now experimentally tested over 500 compounds and found several promising candidates which we are now testing further. All data is publicly available on the site: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;postera.ai&#x2F;covid\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;postera.ai&#x2F;covid</a><p>Inspired by open-source software, we\u2019re seeing advantages of open-science collaboration in areas where market incentives are lacking. We started with the opportunity to connect drug hunters with the latest ML, but have expanded this into a platform that helps connect scientists with each other. This is particularly needed when it comes to drug discovery logistics\u2014the fragment screens are conducted in Oxford and The Weizmann Institute in Israel, computational methods are done by PostEra in California and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, and chemical synthesis is carried out across several countries. Many of the features we are rolling out, such as automated alerts on suggested drug designs, open forum discussions, and live data uploads, feel very akin to a \u2018GitHub for drug development\u2019.<p>Identifying biological mechanisms of diseases and forecasting clinical outcomes are huge problems, but we believe that the chemistry stage of drug discovery can become a reliable industry rather than an artisanal craft. Machine learning tech is a key part and we&#x27;re still working on it, but our clients have been constantly reminding us that just the logistical aspects of drug discovery are a great source of pain. Science software is also notoriously hard to use so we&#x27;ve learned that combining good UI with good ML should be our ambition. Our current mantra is: ordering a molecule through PostEra should be as easy as ordering a pizza!<p>We need more researchers, coders and chemists to help us on this journey and we\u2019d love to hear from you if our vision sounds like something you could get on board with!

If I have a list of drug candidates and your software can apply a confidence level on the best route to synthesize a product that is better than chemists you&#x27;re company is very valuable.<p>Inital thoughts - defining easy of synthetic pathway seems hard. If I&#x27;m an organic chemist and the recommended molecule involves a cost, technique or equipment that&#x27;s inaccessible then I&#x27;d be stuck. However, if your network of manufactures can make it then labs may consider outsourcing it. I commonly see 10 to 1000x pricing differences in custom synthesis so there&#x27;s also a risk of one vendor quoting too high and development prematurely stopping. For context and those that maybe outside this field, you can get a quote for over a million dollars for scaling up a product such as 100mg to 10g (not even a new route). You may need large amounts of the molecule for assay, animal testing, humans trials and going to market. Technique and equipment may not be an issue if your network is large enough, It will be interesting to see if you charge the drug companies as like a SaaS play and&#x2F;or percent of sale from manufacturers like the YC company Science Exchange. Another idea is offering the software for free and make a percentage on the patent (IP) related the pathway.",

            "text": "Yes absolutely, the variance of pricing across different custom synthesis providers can be surprising. This we think though is actually an opportunity to serve our end users (drug hunters) better. Generally the cost of synthesis is a function of raw material costs and the labor time (translates to number of synthetic steps and risk of each step). All these parameters are datapoints we have access to or can model through ML. As such we&#x27;ve found that the ability to search large chemical databases is a huge saving when many clients may often just default to use a single CRO provider who may not be the best provider for their synthesis request. We are aiming to build a good network of reliable CRO providers to address the shortcoming and work with them to improve algorithms to optimize for reaction conditions etc.<p>Regarding pricing model this is something we are still working on. And yes you&#x27;ve hit the nail on the head -- We could charge the drug hunter (SaaS or IP) or we could charge the CROs that we send the custom synthesis to. Love to hear your thoughts here.",

I&#x27;ve seen CROs instantly cut pricing in half if you present another option.<p>I would be cautious with chemical database (unsure which you are using) as there are companies that post chemicals as lead generation and cannot make them.<p>If you solve the selection of the best route, helping with sourcing the product may not be worth your resources. In other words, just that piece alone, if done well, is very valuable and hope the market sees it.",

We then tell the CRO what building blocks they need and the route design.

        "text": "A few random thoughts I&#x27;m curious about (full disclosure: I worked in anti-infectives R&amp;D as a bioinformatician early in my career for a major pharma)<p>1) One big challenge in synthesis is ensuring compound purity. Even when I was working in pharma, it was often the case that some of the compounds in the screening library could be contaminated with intermediates. This is murder for any kind of anti-infectives research because you end up with false-positives for toxic intermediates. Since your assay is often, &quot;does the compound kill the bug?&quot; the answer for most chemicals is, &quot;yes!&quot;. How do you ensure the purity of what you deliver to your customers? If I&#x27;m a medicinal chemist wanting to try this, I want to know that I&#x27;m not getting a vial of brick dust back.<p>2) Just because you have a mechanism to synthesize, doesn&#x27;t mean the yield is going to be great. Does your algorithm factor in yield when selecting the route?<p>3) When I started reading your post I thought, &quot;Hats off to these folks, this is a super hard problem that no shortage of extremely smart people have spent years trying to solve.&quot; Then I got to the moonshot section! The number of small molecule antiviral drugs with efficacy is vanishingly small. I understand why you would try to tackle this, but it truly is a moonshot.<p>4) I can&#x27;t help but wonder what Derek Lowe (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.sciencemag.org&#x2F;pipeline&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.sciencemag.org&#x2F;pipeline&#x2F;</a>) thinks of all this, have you guys tried to reach out to him?",

In our Moonshot project, the assay cascade comprises biochemical assays against the main protease (2 different assay methodologies, run in Oxford and Weizmann Institute) and live virus assays, thus we should be able to infer whether the activity is caused by impurities killing the virus. In addition, we also perform high-throughput x-ray crystallography to determine the structures of all the protein-ligand complexes, which serves an an orthogonal assay.<p>2. Yes, our algorithm does factor in the yield when it decides which reaction to use.<p>3. You&#x27;re absolutely right. It is very ambitious but we&#x27;ve realized that even if we don&#x27;t get our compounds into human trials (currently aiming for in-vivo testing in next few weeks) that we will still have generated a lot of useful data that is there in the open for when the next pandemic comes around. This has been a real weakness from prior pandemic where research wasn&#x27;t continued and certainly wasn&#x27;t stored in clean accessible ways. As I&#x27;m sure you know SARS has super high genetic similarity to current COV-2 so having prior data accessible and cleaned would have given researchers a real head start.<p>4. Yes Derek is aware of COVID Moonshot and is also of the opinion that is it both ambitious but sadly necessary. We continue to follow his posts as healthy skepticism particularly in the area of AI for drug discovery is always helpful.",

It often falls into two situations:<p>(1) If the customer knows exactly the custom design they want to get made, we can help them find the best way to purchase or synthesize it. In many cases, customers may have trouble coordinating with CROs themselves, finding the best building blocks and route to the molecule, and dealing with logistics. We try to help ease that pain.<p>(2) The customer has a specific target they want to hit and they need just the right small molecule to &quot;fit&quot; in it. We also help with this, mainly through partnerships. And our thinking is that good design of small molecule inhibitors (such as one targeting the COVID main protease) involves expert knowledge of what can be quickly made and tested to help guide further design.<p>Lastly, we also work on suggesting molecules that may be slightly different from what the customer thinks they want, but may show similar activity -- and will be much easier to make.",

(The other side of this applies too, if you buy a popular cat video sharing site, you&#x27;re going to inherit lots of &quot;allow autoplay&quot; type permissions) but that&#x27;s something you&#x27;d probably explicitly plan for rather than being a surprise.<p>White and black lists maintained by third parties may impact you. Whether that&#x27;s a DNS blacklist that means some PiHoles block your whole site because the previous owner was an advertising network, or a spam blacklist that ensures your newsletter is never seen by its subscribers, that could be a real problem. Some list maintainers are very responsive, others not so much.<p>Speaking of lists, the domain could be on the PSL. Again you can ask to be removed (or indeed added if your planned use would mean the domain should be on the PSL and isn&#x27;t). But if you don&#x27;t realise the domain is PSL listed, you&#x27;ll be astonished that it&#x27;s impossible to get a Let&#x27;s Encrypt certificate for *.example.com, or that cookies and frames and other origin-restricted stuff doesn&#x27;t work as you expect.",

        "text": "&gt; The Coding will always be the easiest part of a Coding Career<p>I&#x27;m a little triggered by this headline. I understand what it means, and I agree there&#x27;s some truth to it. It can be good advice when given to developers who haven&#x27;t yet figured out that their job is not exclusively to write code.<p>But in my company (which is a big non-tech corporate) I&#x27;ve noticed that a similar phrase often gets used by non-technical people to belittle the work that software developers do. The exact wording varies, but the sentiment is basically that technical problems are easy, and can safely be outsourced to the lowest bidder, as long as there&#x27;s a good Project Manager who can enforce the right methodology and processes. It&#x27;s the problems that require &quot;soft&quot; skills that are <i>difficult</i> - these are the kind that Thought Leaders and Influencers work on - and we need to pay a premium for people who can solve these problems.<p>In reality, technical and non-technical problems are both difficult in their own ways, and both occupy a space that ranges from trivial to impossible.<p>In terms of career advice, I&#x27;d really suggest not perpetuating this myth. One of the tactics that the book lists is &quot;marketing yourself&quot;, and repeating the idea that coding is easy (especially to non-technical people) undermines your career and that of your technical colleagues.",

                    "text": "There are different strategies you would use for dealing with different companies, especially for companies with very deeply broken incentives or broken feedback loops (no company is perfect, but many function reasonably well, and some function not at all).  You can&#x27;t fix a broken process for decision-making, by making a few isolated good decisions; you have to attack&#x2F;fix the broken process itself, if you ever really hope to make an impact.<p>- If you are working a company that has broken incentive structures, the first and immediate question you should answer for yourself is, what do you want to achieve there, as a manager?  Are you really going to try and fix these deep cultural issues, and try to improve the company as a whole (or even just your department), and its whole internal mechanism for decision-making (which is broken and based on bad incentives)?<p>- If so, great! Commit to that problem, build support, get alignment, and who knows you might actually succeed, and end up in a C-level role for your efforts of turning the ship around.  It&#x27;s unlikely, but if that&#x27;s your goal, then have at it.<p>- If not, then who cares?  Accept the risks of what you signed up for, get whatever it is done that you need to do, and leave when the time is right.  Understand your place in the hierarchy, understand what your personal goals are and how you can achieve them, and do whatever you need to do, without worrying about the health of the company or how other decisions are made.  If you can&#x27;t change it, or the effort to change it is out of the scope of what you&#x27;re personally trying to achieve in your career goals, then it is literally a waste of time and energy.<p>---<p>On the topic of indicators or lack thereof, this is literally what good managers do.  They find insights that others miss, and are successful in either making winning arguments or in framing debates differently and changing the success criteria.  These powers can be used for &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; to be blunt, that&#x27;s up to the individual manager.  You can practice at a small scale, for example for operational improvements by creating new metrics&#x2F;KPIs for your team to better monitor service health in different ways than they used to.  You can apply this to business decisions as well, by providing new analyses of how out-sourcing did not actually pay off, and defining new metrics for how to make those decisions (given that you&#x27;ve uncovered some hidden factors that were missed in the initial evaluation). There&#x27;s no magic spell to it, it&#x27;s just work and experience and critical thinking, which you gain through repeated application of curiosity and tenacity to problems that others tend to overlook or are too stuck in their ways to think differently about.<p>Personally, I loathe projects where I have little autonomy, and so I proactively seek out problems that other people don&#x27;t want to own or have avoided owning or simply didn&#x27;t understand or appreciate their important, but which I believe to be important problems (which depends on the prerequisite that, I actually must have some real insights which are unique that others have missed), and so I go out of my way to carve out ownership of those problems. Because nobody understood them before or wanted it before anyways, I don&#x27;t get much pushback, and I can use these opportunities to make decisions autonomously, and also build up trust and support by demonstrating success with such projects.  Eventually, I can leverage my banked trust store and positive balance of success, to push for changes or influence decisions in other areas that are more contentious and may not have gone &quot;my way&quot;, had I not done the work to build up trust previously",

A few years ago I was so tired of this that I created a generic project and then a script that would take a JSON file and would generate the Swift Models, as well as API calls-&gt;transform to Model, and I would just need to create 2-3 functions to configure each cell depending on the data. I haven&#x27;t seen any junior developers do something like this in their jobs. There are more and more classes, view controllers, components, stores etc. The abstraction thinking just isn&#x27;t there <i>yet</i>. But they act like they know everything and have all the answers because of GitHub stars or whatever they are called.<p>I am all over the place with this reply, I am sorry. Just after years and years of seeing this, more and more I don&#x27;t think soft development is for me if it is just to become the Instagram of the geeks.",

I provide curation and context.<p>- Theoretical foundation: I do my best to ensure what i see in real life is backed up by indisputable logical&#x2F;psychological axioms. This is important for replicability.<p>- Personal Experience: I apply what I learn to myself.<p>Every weakness can be a strength (funny enough, i spend a whole chapter talking about this). In my case, i&#x27;ve basically made a career out of putting out what i learn as i learn it, before i&#x27;m an expert, with the responsible disclaimer that I am not an expert but I do put a ton of work into thinking and research. it&#x27;s the opposite of &quot;fake it til you make it&quot;, its being real that you havent made it yet but <i>you do not let that stop you trying</i>. I am at the exact point where my voice and perspective on things (being a recent beginner) let me explain things to beginners in ways that experts can&#x27;t.<p>Yes it&#x27;s uncomfortable af. But you see tremendous growth when you are both intellectually honest and doggedly persistent at this.<p>As I wrote this book I was also overcome with this personal insight - <i>me 5 years from now would probably not pick this book to write</i>. I would be interested in different things, different challenges. This is pretty much the only time I would ever write a junior-dev-to-senior-dev book: right after having done it.<p>I suspect this is why so few junior-dev-to-senior-dev books exist - people wait too long, and then by the time they feel qualified to write a book, they care more about management or architecture or what have you.<p>short answer: no i don&#x27;t feel very qualified right now. i do intend to update this for a few years. how long until i am qualified? we shall see.",

In no other industry can you be a 27 year old and be anything other than junior-to-mid. I say this as someone who was a senior developer in my late 20&#x27;s, and you don&#x27;t know anything in your late 20&#x27;s.<p>But I suppose if you&#x27;re a senior developer after a couple years, what&#x27;s to say you can&#x27;t advise people on their careers when you haven&#x27;t even made it through a Presidential election?",

I want to weigh in with a positive perspective.<p>I&#x27;ve been following Shawn for a while now (from a distance) and I have to say, seeing his name pop up in more and more places has certainly been an intriguing experience. He went from being nobody a few years ago to being somebody worth listening to very quickly.<p>He&#x27;s built up a lot of good will with me just from what he&#x27;s posted that is freely available, so it&#x27;s a little frustrating to see other people bashing &#x2F; looking for problems as soon as he releases something with a price tag. I personally have benefited a lot from his &quot;learn in public&quot; approach (more from his example than from his advice!!) and have had multiple posts hit the front page of HN by &quot;learning in public&quot;, from which I&#x27;ve learned further (it&#x27;s a positive feedback loop).<p>Full discloser, I haven&#x27;t read this book, but the interesting thing is that he&#x27;s only recently started monetizing this exposure. That rings true to me of somebody who knows what they&#x27;re doing and has real value to bring to the table.<p>For people who are saying &quot;But he doesn&#x27;t have enough experience,&quot; bear in mind that this book has ~1400 references to other peoples&#x27; experience. I trust that way more than I do one person&#x27;s singular viewpoint, even if that is backed up by 40 years&#x27; worth of experience.<p>Also, before anybody tries to call me out \u2013 this is a 100% spontaneous response and I had no idea Shawn&#x27;s book was out until I saw this post on the front page of HN.",

So glad to launch it today!<p>Since I switched careers from finance and started doing freeCodeCamp in 2017, I have been studying the principles, strategies, and tactics that make great developers successful and applying it to my own career. This has helped me get hired at a Senior level at AWS in just 3 years. While between jobs, I decided to take the time to write down everything I&#x27;ve learned about the tech industry - everything I wish I had known, everything I believe to be true, everything I think an individual contributor developer needs to build an exceptional career:<p>- Going from Junior to Senior<p>- Learning in Public<p>- Tech Strategy (the Business of Software)<p>- Why You Should Write (A Lot!)<p>- Engineering Career Ladders<p>- Developer&#x27;s Guide to Twitter<p>- Marketing Yourself (without Being a Celebrity)<p>- and more!<p>Roughly 1&#x2F;4 of the chapters are prior blogposts that have done super well - my greatest hits include <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.swyx.io&#x2F;writing&#x2F;learn-in-public&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.swyx.io&#x2F;writing&#x2F;learn-in-public&#x2F;</a> and <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.swyx.io&#x2F;writing&#x2F;marketing-yourself&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.swyx.io&#x2F;writing&#x2F;marketing-yourself&#x2F;</a> - and since publishing them I have loads of feedback and rewritten them for the book. The remaining 3&#x2F;4 are brand new content I have applied for my own career, and market tested the messaging in tweets, talks and podcasts.<p>There&#x27;s a launch discount applied to everything on the site; I hope you enjoy it!<p>---<p>Side note on tech stack - For the book, I am using <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;softcover.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;softcover.io</a> which is a Rails app that Michael Hartl uses to create the Rails tutorial. It&#x27;s the best tool I found that generates PDF&#x2F;EPUB&#x2F;MOBI out of the box with decent customization by exposing LaTeX (and its also FOSS, with a paid option!). For my site I am using Begin.com for hosting and functions, Svelte for components, and Podia for payments. For Audiobook I am using Audacity and my trusty standard issue Egghead.io Instructor Shure mic! Putting this together was a good couple weeks of trial and error - Let me know if I can answer any tech stack questions alongside book questions!",
